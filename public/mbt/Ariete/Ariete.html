                            <p class="p1">The C1 Ariete (English: battering ram, ram) is a 3rd generation main battle tank of the Italian Army, developed by Consorzio Iveco Oto Melara (CIO), a consortium formed by IVECO and OTO Melara. The chassis and engine were produced by Iveco, while the turret and fire-control system were supplied by OTO Melara. The vehicle carries the latest optical and digital-imaging and fire-control systems, enabling it to fight day and night and to fire on the move. Six prototypes were developed by 1988, which were subject to intensive testing. The following year the vehicles travelled a combined 16,000 km. Deliveries were first planned for 1993, and took place in 1995 due to delays. Final delivery occurred 7 years later in August 2002.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Ariete's main armament is 120 mm smoothbore gun, designed by OTO Breda, similar to the Rheinmetall L/44. The gun
                        fires most NATO-standard rounds of the same calibre. It carries 42 rounds, 15 ready rounds are stored vertically on the
                        left side of the main gun breech. The other 27 are stowed in a hull rack to the left of the driver's station. The gun
                        barrel has a thermal insulating sleeve and a fume extractor; it is fully stabilized in both azimuth and elevation by an
                        electro-hydraulic drive system. </p>

                        <p class="p2">Secondary armament consists of a 7.62 mm MG 42/59 coaxial machine gun operated by the tank gunner or commander and an
                        additional 7.62 mm MG 42/59 configured as an anti-aircraft weapon operated by the main-gun loader from his hatch.</p>

                        <h3>1.2 - Fire Control and Target Acquisition</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The tank's advanced fire-control system, manufactured by Galileo Avionica, is designated OG14L3 TURMS, and includes day
                        and night panoramic capability for the commander's SP-T-694 primary sight (developed collaboratively by SFIM/Galileo), a
                        stabilized platform including a thermal gunner's sight and a laser rangefinder to increase accuracy and expedite target
                        detection and targeting, and a digital fire-control computer, which is capable of measuring wind speed, humidity, and
                        exterior weather conditions, combining them with the turret's angle of elevation, attitude, and the barrel's physical
                        wear to increase accuracy.</p>

                        <p class="p2">This computer is also a component of the tank's navigation system and allows for the exchange of tactical information
                        between vehicles in a network. The Ariete has a "hunter-killer" capability in which the commander spots and designates
                        targets for the gunner in a 360° field of vision around the vehicle without changing his position or having to open the
                        turret hatch for visual identification of targets. The commander's sight also has a vertical traverse from –10° to +60°
                        from the horizontal, which allows the tank to engage low-flying airborne threats—primarily helicopters. During night fighting, the commander and gunner both share the thermal sight which is able to resolve a 2.3×x2.3 m target from a distance of 1,500 m.</p>

                        <h3>1.3 - Crew and Tank Protection</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Ariete's armour is a steel and composite blend, the turret front shape is similar to the British Challenger 1 and
                        the American M1 Abrams.
                        The Ariete features two side-mounted, electronically fired GALIX 80mm grenade launchers. Each launcher consists of
                        four 80 mm barrels which can be intermixed with either smoke or chaff grenades. The smoke grenades are capable of
                        shrouding the tank from visual or thermal detection, while the chaff grenades disperse the tank's radar cross section.
                        The tank is fully NBC protected.</p>

                        <h3>1.4 - Powerplant and Drivetrain</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Ariete is powered by a 25.8-litre turbo-charged Fiat-Iveco MTCA 12-cylinder diesel engine in a Vee configuration
                        rated at 937 kilowatts (1,250 hp) at 2,300 rpm, with a maximum torque of 4,615 N·m at 1,600 rpm driving through a ZF LSG3000 automatic transmission, with four forward gears and two reverse, allowing for a top cruising speed of 65 km/h and a 0–32 km/h acceleration in 6 seconds. The computer-controlled transmission allows it to climb grades rated up to
                        60%, and can ford waterways of up to 1.25 m on-the-fly. The entire engine and transmission assembly can be replaced in
                        under 1 hour.</p>

                        <h2>Ariete AMV</h2>

                        <p class="p2">In the early 2000s, the Italian Army was interested in developing a new version of Ariete (C2 Ariete or Ariete Mk. 2
                        designations were considered) which would enter service over the following years with the planned acquisition of 300
                        units.[5] Budget limitations drastically reduced the number of improved Ariete (order reduced to 200) and eventually
                        caused the subsequent cancellation of the program. The planned improvements were therefore to be applied to the C1
                        Ariete during the future major revisions.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Ariete AMV is a mid life update (Ammodernamento di Mezza Vita) of the Ariete for 125 units and includes:</p>

                        <p class="p2">Upgraded IVECO V12 MTCA with common-rail injection and 1,500 hp (1,103 kW)
                        Upgraded transmission
                        New tracks
                        New electronics and optronics (LOTHAR SD for the gunner, Multispectral ATTILA D for the commander)
                        Add-on armor and mine protection
                        Integration of SICCONA battlefield management system
                        Ariete AMV is undergoing upgrades, adding more hull and turret armor + improved optics (2023)</p>
