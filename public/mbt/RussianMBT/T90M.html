                            <p class="p1">The T-90 is a third-generation Russian main battle tank developed to replace the T-72. It uses a 125 mm 2A46 smoothbore main gun, the 1A45T fire-control system, an upgraded engine, and gunner's thermal sight. Standard protective measures include a blend of steel and composite armour, smoke grenade dischargers, Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour (ERA) and the Shtora infrared anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) jamming system.</p>

                            <h3>1.1 - Armament</h3>
                        
                        
                        
                            <p class="p2">The T-90's main armament is the 2A46M 125mm smoothbore tank gun. This is a highly modified version of the Sprut
                            anti-tank gun, and is the same gun used as the main armament on the T-80-series tanks. It can be replaced without dismantling the inner turret and can fire armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS), high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT-FS), and high-explosive fragmentation (HE-FRAG) ammunition, and 9M119M Refleks anti-tank guided missiles.</p>

                            <p class="p2">Like other modern Russian tanks the 2A46M in the T-90 is fed by an automatic loader which removes the need for a manual loader in the tank and reduces the crew to 3 (commander, gunner, and driver). The autoloader can carry 22 ready-to-fire
                            rounds in its carousel and can load a round in 5–8 seconds.</p>

                            <p class="p2">Fire-control system on the T-90 includes the PNK-4S/SR AGAT day and night sighting system mounted at the commanders station which allows for night time detection of a tank sized target at ranges between 700 and 1100 metres depending on the version of the sight. Early models of the T-90 were equipped with the TO1-KO1 BURAN sight but later models (T-90S) were upgraded to use the ESSA thermal imaging sight, which allows for accurate firing to a range of 5,000–8,000m during day and 3,300m during night, using the CATHERINE-FC thermal camera produced by Thales Optronique.</p>
                        
                            <div class="design-box">

                            <h3>1.2 - Mobility</h3>
                        
                            <p class="p2">The prime mover is the V-92S diesel engine, built in the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant. Different models of the T-90 tank are powered by various motors in its initial models, like the V-84MS 840 hp four-stroke V-12 piston engine, uprated 1,000 hp engines and 1,250 hp engines made by Uralvagonzavod and are delivered by Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant. The Т-90S with 1,000 hp engine can attain a top speed of 60 km/h on the road and up to 45 km/h on rough terrain. The T-90 tank has a typical drivetrain arrangement, with a rear placed engine and transmission. The 1,000 hp engines are V-92 four stroke, 12 cylinder, multi-fuel diesel while the 1,250 hp engine is V-96. The T-90 export version i.e. modified T-90S is fitted with an increased power multi-fuel 1,000 hp diesel engine with turbochargers. The tank has an air conditioning system for work in hot places.</p>

                            <p class="p2">The T-90 has a "three-tiered" protection system. The first tier is the composite armour in the turret, consisting of basic armour shell with an insert of alternating layers of aluminum and plastics and a controlled deformation section.</p>

                            <div class="design-box">

                            <p class="p2">The second tier is third generation Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour (ERA) bricks which degrade the penetrating power of kinetic-energy APFSDS ammunition. These bricks give the turret a distinctive angled "clam shell" appearance. ERA bricks are also located on the turret roof to protect against attacks from above.</p>

                            <p class="p2">The third tier is a Shtora-1 (Russian: Штора-1 or "curtain" in English) countermeasures suite, produced by
                            Elektromashina of Russia. This system includes two electro-optical/IR "dazzlers" (i.e. active infrared jammer) on the
                            front of the turret (which gives the distinctive "Red Eyes"), four laser warning receivers, two 3D6 'smoke' grenade
                            discharging systems and a computerised control system. The Shtora-1 warns the tank's crew when the tank has been
                            'painted' by a weapon-guidance laser and allows the crew to slew the turret to face the threat. The infrared jammer, the
                            TShU1-7 EOCMDAS, jams the semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) guidance system used by some anti-tank guided
                            missiles.</p>

                            <p class="p2">In addition to the passive and active protection systems, the T-90 is also fitted with nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection equipment, KMT mine sweeps and an automatic fire suppression system.</p>

                            <p class="p2">T-90M and T-90MS mounts the more advanced "Relikt" ERA. Relikt defends against tandem warheads, while reducing the penetration of APFSDS rounds by over 50 percent. It can be installed instead of Kontakt-1 or Kontakt-5</p>

                            <div class="design-box">

                            <p class="p2">The T-90A / T-90S turret uses a stronger steel alloy, giving an approximately 10–15% increase in the protection level given from the steel elements of the armor array; as the array from many aspects is not wholly steel, the overall increase in protection is less than this margin over these areas. Protection values will decrease somewhat
                            against Tandem HEAT or penetrators with precursor tips. These measures are not as effective against heavier, newer
                            generations of E.R.A. such as Relikt.</p>

                            <p class="p2">Heavily upgraded version of the T-90, first appearance in public in 2017. The main feature is modernisation of turret design ("all welded" instead of cast) with the new advanced fire control system Kalina (with integrated combat
                            information and control systems), new Irbis-K gunner's sight and four video cameras that provide a 360° view of the
                            environment for the commander, new upgraded gun 2A46M-5 with coaxial machine gun 7.62 mm, weapon station "UDP T05BV-1"
                            with remotely controlled machine gun 12.7 mm "Kord". There is improved armor on the ammunition carousel. Each side of
                            the hull is fitted with additional armor plates at the front and slat armor at the rear. The new version also includes
                            brand new Relikt ERA on turret and hull, "soft kill" APS Shtora-1 without the (now obsolete) jammers, and "hard kill"
                            APS Arena-M. ERA on the front of the turret is made of one "cast" and is easily replaceable in the field by
                            a crew. Other improvements include a new 1130 hp V-92S2F engine coupled with automatic transmission, an enhanced
                            environmental control system and GLONASS satellite navigation systems. It also features an upgraded autoloader AZ-185M2
                            which allows for longer (and thus more effective) APFSDS ammunition Svinets-1 and Svinets-2. Much of the ammunition
                            stored outside the autoloader has been moved from around the hull to the rear of the turret with added blowout panels in
                            the event the ammunition suffers a catastrophic explosion, protecting the crew and other sensitive equipment.</p>

                            <p class="p2">Export variant of T-90AM ("Proryv-2"), first time showed in Abu Dhabi IDEX-2013. It is equipped
                            with a 1,130 hp engine, a Sosna-U gunner sight, a UDP T05BV-1 RWS with a 7.62 mm machine gun, GLONASS, inertial
                            navigation systems, new Relikt explosive reactive armour that covers more of the tank, and a steering wheel. A new removable turret bustle is included, which provides storage for eight additional rounds.
                            The T-90MS is ready for serial production. Four video cameras provide a 360° view of the environment, while the
                            tank is more connected to command.[106] The T-90SM has an upgraded thermal imager that can detect tanks over 3,300
                            meters away. The same autoloader as the T-90M "Proryv-3" is used..</p>
