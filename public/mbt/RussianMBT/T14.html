                            <p class="p1">The T-14 Armata (Russian: Т-14 «Армата») is a Russian main battle tank based on the Armata Universal Combat Platform. The Russian Army initially planned to acquire 2,300 T-14s between 2015 and 2020. By 2018, production and
                            fiscal shortfalls delayed this to 2025, before Russia announced the apparent cancellation of the main production run
                            on 30 July 2018. However, as of 2021, the Russian state-owned TASS media agency claimed the Armata had been expected
                            to begin serial production in 2022, with delivery of a test batch of 100 to the 2nd Guards Tamanskaya Motor Rifle
                            Division expected to begin in 2022.</p>

                        <h2>Design</h2>

                        <p class="p2">The Armata was designed over the course of five years, and features a number of innovative characteristics, including an
                        unmanned turret. The crew of three is seated in an armoured capsule in the front of the hull, which will also include a toilet for the crew.</p>

                        <h3>Armament</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Vacuum-1 Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot (APFSDS) round, developed for the 2A82-1M gun, has a
                        penetrator that is 900 mm long, and is said to be capable of penetrating 1000 mm of Rolled Homogeneous Armor (RHA)
                        equivalent at a distance of 2 km. The new controlled-detonation Teknik HE-Frag shell is available and has
                        entered service. The gun is capable of firing new guided missiles like the 9M119M1 Invar-M which has an effective
                        range of 100 m to 5 km, and can engage low-flying air targets such as helicopters,[64] with a new 3UBK21 Sprinter
                        Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) with an effective range up to 12 km developed specifically for it. The 3UBK25
                        active homing ATGM is currently under development.</p>

                        <div class="design-box">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="photos/7eom3jxrfct31.png" width="800" height="600" alt="">
                                <figcaption class="figcaption">
                                    T-14's Ammunition againts other APFSDS'
                                </figcaption>
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p class="p2">The secondary armament consists of a 12.7×108mm Kord (GRAU index 6P49) machine gun with 300 rounds (not observed during
                        the 2015 parade) and a 7.62×54mmR Pecheneg PKP (GRAU Index: 6P41) or a PKTM (6P7К) machine gun with 1,000 rounds. All guns are remotely controlled. In addition, another 1,000 rounds can be stored separately.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The 152 mm cannon, which was first developed in 2000 for the T-95 prototype, has a high-speed APFSDS shell with a
                        1,980 m/s muzzle velocity, only dropping to 1,900 m/s at 2 km. However, Russian engineers have so far kept
                        the 125 mm-size gun, assessing that improvements in ammunition are enough to increase effectiveness while concluding
                        that a larger bore weapon would offer few practical advantages.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The T-14 could also be modified to use anti-aircraft missiles. A 30 mm anti-aircraft gun could be installed in
                        the near future.</p>

                        <p class="p2">In August 2022, Russian media reported that the 38th Research, Development, and Testing Institute of Armoured Hardware
                        and Armament proposed a list of new features for a prospective future T-14 design at the turn of the 2030s, which
                        included the following:</p>

                        <p class="p2">System of symbiosis between T-14 tank and dedicated reconnaissance drone,
                        152 mm main gun,
                        Thermobaric ammo for 152 mm,
                        Supersonic armor-piercing ammo for 152 mm
                        ATGM for 152 mm with aiming/guidance system “fire and forget”,
                        Improved target detection and identification at 6+ km,
                        Redesigned turret and new autoloader for accommodating 152 mm gun and ammo.</p>

                        </div>

                        <h3>Mobility</h3>

                        <p class="p2">During the prototype stage, several engines with power outputs ranging from 1,500 to 2,000 hp were tested on the
                        platform, with the 1,500 hp version reportedly allowing a max speed of 82 km/h. The T-14 is powered by a ChTZ 12N360
                        (A-85-3A) diesel engine with a displacement of 34.6 liters delivering up to 1,500 hp. The engine's theoretical maximum power, which is not normally used, is 1,500 kW (2,000 hp), at the cost of radically decreasing
                        its service life, with a projected minimum 2,000 hours at a nominal 1,500 hp comparable to other modern tank engines, and up to 10,000 hours at a moderated 1,200 hp. The engine is electronically controlled. Operational range is over 500 km.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The T-14 has a 12-speed automatic gearbox, with a top speed of 80–90 km/h (50–56 mph). Sources suggest a partly or
                        fully hydrostatic transmission.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Unlike previous Russian and Soviet designs, such as the T-90/80/72/64, the T-14 has seven 700 mm road wheels per side,
                        based on the T-80 variant. This may have been done to improve the pivoting ability of the tank, as an active
                        suspension system improves the target lock time by a factor of 2.2, and reduces the timeframe between target detection
                        and reaction by 31%, all due to the resulting smoother ride.</p>

                        <h3>Protection</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The main protective armor is built with a new steel codenamed 44S-SV-SH, which has extremely high durability and is able
                        to withstand extreme temperature environments. It is 15% lighter than steel used on older tanks. There is also
                        completely new approach to composite armor with an unknown ceramic layer and utilizing Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA)
                        within its base design, as a continuous layer (not in a form of added "bricks"). Applique armor is on the sides in
                        forward 2/3. Slat (cage) armor is in the rear 1/3 on the sides and the back.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The T-14's crew of three is protected by an internal armored capsule. Both the chassis and the turret are equipped
                        with the Malachit dual-ERA system on the front, sides and the top. The tank uses an integrated, computerized control
                        system which monitors the state and functions of all tank modules. In battle, the software can analyze threats and then
                        either suggest or automatically take actions to eliminate them, while without the external threat it can detect and
                        rectify crew errors. Serial production of the Armata Platform's ceramic armor components began in mid-2015.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The tank features the Afganit (Russian: Афганит) active protection system (APS). Previous Russian APS were either "hard
                        kill" versions (Drozd, Arena) or "soft kill" version (Shtora-1). Hard-kill measures kinetically attack threatening
                        missiles or other munitions, while soft kill measures disrupt guidance systems (laser dazzlers or infrared emitters).
                        Afganit is about to introduce the first dual system with both soft and hard actions incorporated. It
                        includes a millimeter-wave radar to detect, track, and intercept incoming anti-tank munitions, both kinetic energy
                        penetrators and tandem-charges. Currently, the maximum speed of the interceptable target is 1,700 m/s (Mach 5.0),
                        with projected future increases of up to 3,000 m/s (Mach 8.8). According to news sources, it protects the tank from
                        all sides, however it is not geared towards shooting upwards to defend against top-attack munitions.</p>

                        <div class="design-box">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="photos/Tower-T14.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="">
                                <figcaption class="figcaption">
                                    Afganit APS
                                </figcaption>
                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p class="p2">Afganit hard-kill launchers are the long tubes mounted in groups of five between the turret's front sides and the
                        chassis. These send out an electronically activated charge that fires an unknown type of warhead towards the target.
                        Many analysts currently assume it is some form of high-explosive fragmentation charge, but the possibility has been
                        raised by other sources of the usage of a more solid warhead (possibly similar to an explosively formed penetrator), as
                        seen in Russian patent RU 2263268. The tank is also equipped with the NII Stali Upper Hemisphere Protection
                        Complex, which consists of two steerable cartridges with 12 smaller charges each, and a turret-top VLS with two more
                        similar cartridges, corresponding to the vehicle's soft kill APS. Additionally, using the AESA radar and
                        anti-aircraft machine gun it is possible to destroy incoming missiles and slow-flying shells (except kinetic energy
                        penetrators).</p>

                        <p class="p2">In July 2015, the deputy director of the Uralvagonzavod tank manufacturing company claimed the T-14 would be invisible
                        to radar and infrared detection due to radar-absorbing paint and the placement of components with heat signatures deep
                        within the hull. The turret's shape is designed to reduce its radio and thermal signature for a stealth ground
                        vehicle. American and Russian armor experts have doubts about these unproven claims. A retired senior U.S.
                        military officer said that sensitive modern thermal technology could detect things such as vehicle movement, a weapon
                        firing, an exposed crewman, or the exhaust of an engine capable of moving a 50-ton tank regardless of heat-generating
                        component placement. Analysts also pointed out that most stealth technology in Russia has been for aircraft to reduce
                        their radar cross section from airborne or ground-based detection, while in a ground vehicle the approach would be to
                        make it indistinguishable from ground clutter to optimize shielding from air-to-ground detection and the two techniques
                        do not necessarily overlap.</p>

                        <h3>Sensors and Communication</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The T-14 is equipped with 26.5–40 GHz active electronically scanned array radar, which is used mainly by the
                        APS. The T-14 uses highly protected communication channels that connect a group of T-14s and the command post.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The commander and gunner have largely identical multispectral image sights, with visible electromagnetic spectrum and
                        thermography channels and laser rangefinders.The commander's sight is installed on the turret top and has a 360°
                        field of view, while the gunner's, situated in the turret's niche to the gun's left, is slaved to it
                        and is additionally equipped with a direct-vision periscopic channel and laser designator for the T-14's gun-launched,
                        SACLOS anti-tank missiles. The detection distance of tank-sized objects for both sights is 7,500 m in
                        daylight, through the TV/periscopic channel, and ≈3,500 m at night through the thermal channel. There is also a backup
                        night-vision capable sight, with 2,000/1,000 m respective detection distances.[1] In addition to traditional vision
                        periscopes, the driver has a forward looking infrared camera and a number of zooming closed-circuit television
                        cameras. Video cameras are installed for all-round vision for the crew, since it lacks the normal vantage point of
                        turret roof hatches. This 360-degree camera coverage is perhaps one of the T-14's most unusual features, made necessary
                        because of extremely limited visibility without them. The crew, clustered in the front of the hull, would have poor
                        situation awareness if the camera setup and video feeds were to fail.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Although the T-14 is touted as an entirely Russian-made next-generation tank, it has been speculated that some
                        components may not be entirely domestically made. In 2015 US cybersecurity analysts Taia Global stated that information
