                            <p class="p1">The T-72 is a family of Soviet main battle tanks that entered production in 1969. The T-72 was a development based off the T-64. About 25,000 T-72 tanks have been built, and
                            refurbishment has enabled many to remain in service for decades. It has been widely exported and has seen service in 40 countries and in numerous conflicts. The Russian T-90 introduced in 1992 and the Chinese Type 99 are further developments of the T-72. Production and development of various modernized T-72 models continues today.</p>

                        <h2>Design</h2>
                        <h3>1.1 - Characteristics</h3>
                    

                    
                    <p class="p2">The T-72 shares many design features with other tank designs of Soviet origin. Some of these are viewed as deficiencies in a straight comparison to NATO tanks, but most are a product of the way these tanks were envisioned to be employed,
                    based on the Soviets' practical experiences in World War II.</p>
                    
                    <div class="design-box">
                    <img src="../History/photos/T72A.jpg" height="600" width="800" alt="">
                    </div>

                    <h3>1.2 - Weight</h3>

                    <p class="p2">The T-72 is extremely lightweight, at 41 tonnes, and very small compared to Western main battle tanks. Some of the roads and bridges in former Warsaw Pact countries were designed such that T-72s can travel along in formation, but
                    NATO tanks could not pass at all, or just one-by-one, significantly reducing their mobility.</p> 
                    
                    <p class="p2">The basic T-72 is
                    relatively underpowered, with a 780 hp supercharged version of the basic 500 hp V12 diesel engine originally designed for the World War II-era T-34. The 0.58 m wide tracks run on large-diameter road
                    wheels, which allows for easy identification of the T-72 and descendants.</p>

                    <h3>1.3 - NBC Protection</h3>

                    <p class="p2">The T-72 has a nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) protection system. The inside of both hull and turret is lined with a synthetic fabric made of boron compound, meant to reduce the penetrating radiation from neutron bomb explosions. The crew is supplied clean air via an air filter system.</p>

                    <h3>1.4 - Interior</h3>

                    <p class="p2">Like all Soviet-legacy tanks, the T-72's design has traded off interior space in return for a very small silhouette and
                    efficient use of armour, to the point of replacing the fourth crewman with a mechanical loader. The low height of the tank places constraints on the height of crews, with the USSR having a height limit of 5ft 4in for crews for the
                    T-72.The basic T-72 design has extremely small periscope viewports, even by the constrained standards of battle tanks and the driver's field of vision is significantly reduced when his hatch is closed.</p>

                        </figure>
                    </div>

                    <h3>1.5 - Armor</h3>

                    <p class="p2">Armour protection of the T-72 was strengthened with each succeeding generation. The original T-72 "Ural" turret is made from conventional cast high hardness steel armor with no laminate inserts. It is believed that the
                    maximum thickness is 280 mm. The glacis of the new laminated armour is 205 mm thick, comprising 80 mm HHS, 105 mm double layer of laminate and 20 mm RHA steel, which when inclined gives about 500–600 mm thickness along the line of sight.</p>

                    <p class="p2">The next armor update was introduced by the T-72A, which was designed in 1976 and replaced the original on the production lines during 1979–1985. The T-72A featured a new turret with thicker, nearly vertical, frontal armour.</p>

                    <p class="p2">Several T-72 models featured explosive reactive armour (ERA), which increased protection primarily against high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) type weapons. Certain late-model T-72 tanks featured Kontakt-5 ERA, a form of universal ERA partly effective against kinetic penetrators.</p>

                    <div class="design-box">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="photos/t72composite.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="">
                            <figcaption class="figcaption">

                        </figure>
                    </div>

                    <p class="p2">Late model T-72s, such as the T-72B, featured improved turret armour, visibly bulging the turret front—nicknamed "super-Dolly Parton" armour by Western intelligence.The turret armour of the T-72B was the thickest and most effective of all Soviet tank armour; it was even thicker than the frontal armour of the T-80B.</p>

                    <p class="p2">After the collapse of the USSR, US and German analysts had a chance to examine Soviet-made T-72 tanks equipped with Kontakt-5 ERA, and they proved impenetrable to most Cold War US and German tank projectiles and anti-tank weapons. The results of these tests show that if a NATO/Warsaw Pact confrontation had erupted in Europe, the Soviets would have had parity (or perhaps even superiority) in armor".KE-effective ERA, such as Kontakt-5, drove the development of M829A3 ammunition.</p>

                    <h3>1.6 - Gun</h3>

                    <p class="p2">The T-72 is equipped with the 125 mm 2A46 series main gun, a significantly larger (20-mm larger) calibre than the standard 105 mm gun found in contemporary Western MBTs, and still slightly larger than the 120 mm/L44 found in many modern Western MBTs. As is typical of Soviet tanks, the gun can fire anti-tank guided missiles, and standard
                    main gun ammunition, including HEAT and APFSDS rounds.</p>

                    <h3>1.7 - Autoloader</h3>

                    <p class="p2">Like the earlier domestic-use-only T-64, the T-72 is equipped with an automatic loading system, eliminating the need for
                    a dedicated crewmember, decreasing the size and weight of the tank.</p>

                    <p class="p2">The autoloader has a minimum cycle of 6.5 seconds (ATGM 8 seconds) and a maximum cycle of 15 seconds for reload, in later versions the sequence mode allows to reload in less than 5 seconds, allowing to reach 3 shots in 13 seconds.</p>

                    <p class="p2">The T-72B3 modernization replaced the old autoloader with a new one to fit longer projectiles such as 3BM59 and 3BM60. Previous variants are limited and may only carry older APFSDS rounds that can not exceed a certain length, therefore allowing less performance from anti-tank rounds.</p>

                    <p class="p2">The way that the unused rounds are stored in the autoloader system has been exposed as a flaw, as observers have noted that penetrating hits can easily set off a chain reaction that detonates all of the ammunition. The result is the turret is blown off resulting in a so-called "jack-in-the-box" explosion. This vulnerability was first observed during the Gulf War.</p>
