                            <p class="p1">The T-80 is a main battle tank that was designed and manufactured in the former Soviet Union and manufactured in Russia. The T-80 is based on the T-64, while incorporating features from the later T-72 and changing the engine to a gas turbine. When it entered service in 1976, it was the first production tank to be powered solely by turbine.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The original T-80 design uses a 1,000 hp monobloc gas turbine engine instead of a 750-hp diesel engine of the T-64; later variants of the T-80 reverted to diesel engine usage. The gearbox is different, with five forward and one reverse gear, instead of seven forward and one reverse. Suspension reverts from pneumatic to torsion bar, with six forged
                        steel-aluminium rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, with the tracks driven by rear sprockets.</p>

                        <h3>1.2 - Armament</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The turret houses the same 125 mm 2A46 smoothbore gun as the T-72, which can fire regular ordnance and anti-tank guided missiles.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The main gun is fed by the Korzina automatic loader. This holds up to 28 rounds of two-part ammunition in a carousel
                        located under the turret floor. Further ammunition is stored in the turret. The ammunition comprises the projectile
                        (APFSDS, HEAT, or HE-Frag), and the propellant charge, or the two-part missile. The autoloader is an effective, reliable, combat tested system that has been in use since the mid-1960s. The propellant charge is held inside a
                        semi-combustible cartridge case made of a highly flammable material, which is consumed in the breech during firing, except for a small metal baseplate.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The autoloader takes between 7.1 and 19.5 seconds to load the main weapon (28 rounds), depending on the initial
                        position of autoloader carousel.</p>

                        <h3>1.3 - Armor</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The glacis is of laminate armour and the turret is armoured steel, with cavities in the turret cheeks containing either
                        a ceramic filling or non-explosive reactive armour elements.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The T-80's armour is composite on the turret and hull, while rubber flaps and sideskirts protect the sides and lower
                        hull. Later T-80 models use explosive reactive armour and stronger armour, like the T-80U and T-80UM1. Other protection systems include the Shtora-1 and Arena APS, and the discontinued Drozd APS.</p>

                        <p class="p2">A disadvantage highlighted during combat in Chechnya was the vulnerability of the T-80BV to catastrophic explosion thought to be caused by the vulnerability of stored semi-combustible propellant charges and missiles when contacted by the molten metal jet from the penetration of a HEAT warhead, causing the entire ammunition load to explode. This
                        vulnerability may be addressed in later models. When Western tank designs changed from non-combustible propellant cartridges to semi-combustible, they tended to separate ammunition stowage from the crew compartment with armoured blast doors, and provided "blow-out" panels to redirect the force and fire of exploding ammunition away from the crew
                        compartment.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Initial model, with 1,000 hp gas turbine engine, coincidence rangefinder, and no missile capability. This model does not
                        have fittings for explosive reactive armour. The turret is from the T-64A, and thus retains the use of the old coincidence rangefinder. Characteristics of this type are the V shaped water deflector on the front glacis, coincidence
                        rangefinder in front of the commander's cupola, and Luna searchlight mounted in the same position as a T-64. Around 250
                        were produced, as the tank's armour was essentially obsolete when introduced.[citation needed] Turret vs APFSDS – 380
                        mm, hull vs APFSDS – 500 mm (without reactive armour). This was, in effect, a pre-production model. It reportedly was fitted with an early version of the Shtora APS.</p>
