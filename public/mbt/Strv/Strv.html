                            <p class="p1">Stridsvagn 122 (strv 122) is a Swedish main battle tank that, like the German Leopard
                            2A5, is based on the German Leopard 2 improved variant utilizing such newer technology as command, control, and
                            fire-control systems, reinforced armour, and long-term combat capacity. Externally, the vehicle is distinguished from
                            the Leopard 2A5 by the French GALIX smoke dispensers, different storage bins, and the thicker crew hatches.</p>

                        <h3>Features</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Leopard PT A's width of 3.75 meters was maintained and the weight increased by 350 kilograms.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Stridsvagn 122 was designed to fight in Swedish conditions including heavily forested areas as well as urban
                        terrain. The designation derives from the 12 cm gun; it was the second tank in Swedish service featuring this calibre (the first being the Strv 121 — a Leopard 2A4 fitted with Swedish lights and radios and painted in Swedish camouflage). Strv 122 needed to overcome the perceived flaws of the original German tank, and features the following:</p>

                        <p class="p2">Heavily reinforced armour to protect against man-portable anti-tank weapons.
                        An advanced CBRN defence system for protection against chemical, biological, and radioactive weapons. Wading capability to pass through water up to 1.4 meters deep.
                        Quick ability to discover, identify, and lock-on a target with the assistance of a laser rangefinder, thermographic
                        camera, and a speed/distance/accuracy calculator for maximum accuracy.
                        Ability to lock-on to numerous targets at once, enabling the tank to fight numerous enemy vehicles without having to
                        manually re-aim the gun after every shot.
                        Active communication for improved cooperation between units.

                        <h3>Production and Service</h3>

                        <p class="p2">As of 2013, 42 of these tanks remained in active service. Most of the leased 160 Leopard 2A4s (local designation
                        Strv 121) were being returned to Germany. The active tanks are divided between three companies, two at P 4, Skövde
                        and one at I 19, Boden. In 2015, the Swedish government decided that another tank company should be established at
                        the P 18 regiment on the island of Gotland. This company was to be trained at P 4 and transferred to P 18 in 2019.</p>

                        <p class="p2">In 2016, Sweden ordered new upgrades for the strv 122 from Krauss-Maffei, with planned delivery between 2018 and
                        2023. Apart from routine renovation, the Stridsledningssystem Bataljon (a tactical command system battalion from
                        SAAB), a new observation/gun sight (TIM) for the commander, and new communication systems for international missions,
                        were to be added. A modular 360° ballistic protection system was originally planned but not implemented. This new
                        upgraded version is designated strv 122C if the upgraded vehicle was originally a 122A variant, or strv 122D if it was
                        an Strv 122B.</p>

                        <p class="p2">In October 2023, the FMV announced that a total of 44 Stridsvagn 122 will be upgraded to the Strv 123A variant,
                        featuring the more powerful L/55 gun, new tracks, improved optics for the commander and gunner, and night sight for the
                        driver. The first Strv 123A tank is to be delivered in 2026.</p>
