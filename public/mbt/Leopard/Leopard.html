                            <p class="p1">The Leopard 2 is a third generation German main battle tank. Developed by Krauss-Maffei in the 1970s, the tank entered service in 1979 and replaced the earlier Leopard 1 as the main battle tank of the West German army. Various
                            iterations of the Leopard 2 continue to be operated by the armed forces of Germany, as well as 13 other European countries, and several non-European countries, including Canada, Chile, Indonesia, and Singapore. Some operating countries have licensed the Leopard 2 design for local production and domestic development.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Leopard 2 uses spaced multilayer armour throughout the design. The armour consists of a combination of steel
                        plates of different hardness, elastic materials, and other non-metallic materials.Steel plates with high hardness and high ductility are used. The armour is a result of extensive research about the formation and penetration mechanism of shaped charge jets. The Leopard 2's armour might be based on the British Burlington armour, which had
                        already been demonstrated to West Germany in 1970.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Leopard 2A4's armour has a maximum physical thickness of 800 millimetres based on unofficial measurements and estimates made by former conscripts and professional soldiers of the German army. On the Leopard 2A5 and subsequent models, the thickness is increased by the wedge-shaped armour module to 1,500 millimetres.</p>

                        ammunition. The side of the hull is covered by armour skirts to increase protection against projectiles and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). The frontal third of the hull sides is covered by heavy ballistic skirts, while the
                        rest of the hull sides is covered by steel-reinforced rubber skirts. For increased protection against mines, the sides
                        of the hull floor are sloped by 45° and the floor is reinforced with corrugations.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Following Leopard 2's introduction into service in 1979, the armour has been gradually improved over the years. A
                        modified version of spaced multilayer armour was introduced beginning with the 97th vehicle of the 6th production batch. The same batch also introduced an improved type of heavy ballistic skirts.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Leopard 2A5 upgrade focused on increased armour protection. While upgrading a Leopard 2 tank to the Leopard 2A5
                        configuration, the roof covering the armour modules is cut open and new armour modules are inserted. New additional armour modules made of laminated armour cover the frontal arc of the turret. They have a distinctive arrowhead shape and improve protection against both kinetic penetrators and shaped charges. The side skirts also incorporate improved armour protection. A 25 mm-thick spall liner reduces the danger of crew injuries in case of armor penetration.</p>

                        <h3>1.2 - Armament</h3>
                    
                        <p class="p2">The primary armament for production versions of the Leopard 2 is the Rheinmetall 120 mm smoothbore gun—the same gun
                        later adapted for use on the M1 Abrams—in either the L/44 variant (found on all production Leopard 2s until the A5), or
                        the L/55 variant (as found on the Leopard 2A6 and subsequent models).</p>
                    
                        <p class="p2">If the ammunition storage area is hit, a blow-off panel in the turret roof would direct an explosion upwards away from
                        the crew compartment. The gun is fully stabilised, and can fire a variety of types of rounds, such as the German DM43 APFSDS-T anti-tank round, which is said to be able to penetrate 560 millimeters of steel armour at a range of 2,000 metres, and the German DM12 high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT).</p>

                        <p class="p2">For the L/55 gun, a newer APFSDS-T round was introduced to take advantage of the longer barrel, the DM-53, which is said
                        to be able to penetrate 750 mm of RHAe armour at a range of 2,000 meters. The bore evacuator and the gun's thermal sleeve of the A4 and A5, designed to regulate the temperature of the barrel, are fabricated from glass-reinforced
                        plastic. The barrel has a chrome lining to increase barrel life. The main gun is capable of power elevating from +20° to −9°.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The standard fire control system found on the Leopard 2 is the German EMES 15 fire control system with a dual magnification stabilised primary sight. The primary sight has an integrated neodymium yttrium aluminium garnet Nd:YAG laser rangefinder and a 120 element mercury cadmium telluride, HgCdTe (also known as CMT) Zeiss thermographic camera,
                        both of which are linked to the tank's fire control computer. A backup 8x auxiliary telescope FERO-Z18 is mounted coaxially for the gunner.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Propulsion</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Leopard 2 is propelled by the MTU MB 873 Ka-501 engine. It provides 1,500 PS (1.1 MW) at 2600 RPM and 4,700 N⋅m of torque at 1600–1700 RPM. The MTU MB 873 Ka-501 is a four-stroke, 47.7 litre, 90° V-block 12-cylinder, twin-turbocharged and intercooled, liquid-cooled diesel engine (with multi-fuel capability). It has an estimated fuel
                        consumption rate of around 300 litres per 100 km on roads and 500 litres per 100 km across the country, and is coupled to the Renk HSWL 354 gear and brake system.</p>

                        <h3 id="Leopard2">Leopard 2</h3>
                    
                        <p class="p2">The baseline Leopard 2, sometimes informally called the "A0" to differentiate it from later versions, was the first
                        series manufactured version. The vehicles were manufactured from October 1979 until March 1982, altogether 380 vehicles.
                        209 were built by Krauss Maffei and 171 by MaK. The basic equipment consisted of electrical-hydraulic stabiliser
                        WNA-H22, a fire control computer, a laser rangefinder, a wind sensor, a general-purpose telescope EMES 15, a panorama periscope PERI R17, the gunner's primary sight FERO Z18, on the turret roof as well as computer-controlled tank testing set RPP 1–8. 200 of the vehicles had a low-light enhancer (PZB 200) instead of thermal imaging. Two chassis served as driver training vehicles.</p>

                        vehicles Leopard 2, designated the A1. Krauss-Maffei built 248 (Chassis Nr. 10211 to 10458) and Mak built 202 (Chassis Nr. 20173 to 20347). Deliveries of the 2A1 models started in March 1982 and ended in November 1983. The two most notable changes were the modification of the ammunition racks to be identical to those in the M1A1 Abrams, and redesigned fuel
                        filters that reduce refuelling time.</p>

                        second and third batches. This modernisation gradually replaced the original PZB 200 sights in the first batch with thermal sights for the EMES 15 as they became available. The upgrade included the fitting of filler openings and caps to the forward hull fuel tanks to allow separate refuelling. There was an addition of a deflector plate for the periscope
                        and a large coverplate to protect the existing NBC protection system. The tank was given new five metre towing cables with a different position. The programme began in 1984 and ended in 1987. The third, fourth and fifth batches, which were produced during this period, had the same features. The modernised first batch can be recognised by the circular plate covering the hole where the crosswind sensor for the fire control system was removed.</p>

                        20644), was delivered between December 1984 and December 1985. The main change was the addition of the SEM80/90 digital radio sets (also being fitted to the Leopard 1 at the same time), and the ammunition reloading hatches being welded
                        shut. Even with these minor changes the new batch was known as the 2A3.</p>

                        automated fire and explosion suppression system, an all-digital fire control system able to handle new ammunition types,
                        and an improved turret with flat titanium/tungsten armour. The Leopard 2s were manufactured in eight batches between
                        1985 and 1992. All the older models were upgraded to 2A4 standard. Until 1994, Germany operated a total of 2,125 2A4s.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Leopard 2 Improved was developed into the Leopard 2A5. Most of its improvements were focused on armour protection;
                        it was enhanced by adding external add-on modules to the turret and replacing the turret's internal armour modules with
                        ones of newer, improved composition. The interior received spall liners to reduce fragments if the armour is penetrated. The commander's sight was moved to a new position behind the hatch and it received an independent
                        thermal channel. The gunner's sight was moved to the turret roof as opposed to the cavity in the front armour in previous models. A heavier sliding driver's hatch was fitted.</p>

                        Netherlands. These were delivered in 2007. Portugal purchased 37 Leopard 2A6s from the Dutch in 2007, with delivery in 2008. In January 2014, Finland purchased 100 L2A6s, as well as munitions, simulators, and a ten-year supply of reserve parts from the Netherlands. The tanks were delivered in batches between 2015 and 2019.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The new Leopard 2 PSO (Peace Support Operations) variant is designed especially for urban warfare, which had been
                        encountered in peacekeeping operations with increasing frequency. The Leopard 2 PSO is equipped with more effective all-around protection, a secondary weapons station, improved reconnaissance ability, an obstacle clearance blade (OCB), a shorter gun barrel for manoeuvring on urban streets at the expense of fire range, non-lethal armament, close-range
                        surveillance ability through camera systems, a searchlight and further changes to improve its perseverance and mobility in built-up non-wide open areas. These features are similar to the Tank Urban Survival Kit for the American M1A2 Abrams.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Leopard 2A7 vehicle is not intended to be optimized for combat in urban terrain, thus it is fundamentally different
                        from the KMW variant, the: 2A7+. A total of 20 vehicles were provided for converting. It involves former Dutch A6NL models returned by Canada to Germany. The original upgrade to A6M has been extended in coordination with
                        Canada and includes a crew-compartment cooling-system from the Leopard 2 A6M-HEL series, a new 20 kW auxiliary power
                        unit based on the Steyr Motors M12 TCA UI engine, the Saab Barracuda Mobile Camouflage System (MCS) with Heat-Transfer Reduction (HTR CoolCam) system, a field trial proven combat management and information system (IFIS:
                        Integriertes Führungs- und Informationssystem), onboard network optimization with ultracapacitors in the chassis and
                        turret, a SOTAS IP digital intercom system, a renewal of the fire suppression system in the crew compartment, and the
