                        <h3>1.1 - Development</h3>

                        <p class="p2">During the development of Type 90-II/Al-Khalid (also known as MBT-2000) in the 1980s, the gearbox and engine were
                        originally imported from Germany, but this plan was abandoned due to a Western arms embargo. The powertrain instead was sourced from Ukraine, the same for most Chinese export vehicles at the time.</p>

                        <p class="p2">China eventually developed domestic powertrains, which led to the creation of the MBT-3000 program for export customers.
                        MBT-3000 was the successor of the Type-90II (MBT-2000) export tank. The MBT-3000 project later named as VT-4 began development in 2009 as a co-operation with the First Inner Mongolia Machinery Factory and other companies.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The MBT-3000 concept debuted at the 2012 Eurosatory. The tank was subsequently shown at the 2014 Norinco Armor
                        Day and the 10th China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition as the VT-4.</p>

                        <h3>1.2 - Armament</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The VT-4 has a ZPT-98A 125 mm smoothbore gun capable of firing APFSDS, HEAT and HE rounds and gun-launched anti-tank
                        guided missiles. There is also a remote controlled weapon station on the turret armed with a 12.7 mm heavy machine gun.
                        The fire-control system has a panoramic sight with hunter-killer capabilities. The gunner sight features a laser rangefinder and a Thales Catherine-FC thermal imager.</p>

                        <h3>1.3 - Protection</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The tank is protected by dual-layer protection consisting of composite armour and FY-4 explosive reactive armour.
                        According to the chief designer Feng Yibai, the frontal protection force is equivalent to 500 mm homogeneous steel armour, and the explosive reactive armour is around 700 mm. The front turret has wedge-shaped armour similar to other
                        contemporary Chinese MBT's and the hull sides have conventional metal sideskirts. The VT-4A1 variant is equipped with a 'hardkill' active protection system designated GL5, defensive grenade launchers and a laser warning device. The vehicle also has an IFF system, NBC protection, explosion-suppression system, fire-extinguishing system and air
                        conditioning.</p>

                        <h3>1.4 - Mobility</h3>

                        <p class="p2">According to Norinco, the VT-4 uses a locally produced 1,200 hp VT/E1 diesel engine with torsion bar suspension
                        and an Ch1000B automatic transmission. Steering and acceleration is handled by a steering wheel and automatic gear transmission. VT-4 is also capable of neutral steering.</p>
