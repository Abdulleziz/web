                            <p class="p1">The Type 99 (Chinese: 99式主战坦克; pinyin: Jiǔjiǔshì Zhǔzhàn Tǎnkè) or ZTZ-99 is a Chinese third generation main battle tank. The vehicle was a replacement for the aging Type 88 introduced in the late 1980s. The Type 99 MBT was China's
                            first mass-produced third-generation main battle tank. Combining modular composite armour and tandem-charge defeating
                            ERA, 125 mm smoothbore gun with ATGM-capability, high mobility, digital systems and optics, the Type 99 represents a
                            shift towards rapid modernization by the PLA.</p>

                        <h3>1.1 - Armament</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The main armament is a 2-plane stabilized ZPT-98 125 mm smoothbore gun with a carousel-style autoloader. The weapon
                        system is derived from Russian 2A46 tank gun and MZ autoloader in the T-72. The gun may be fired under computerized or manual control. The tank can carry 42 rounds including 22 in the autoloader. The rate of fire is 8 rounds per minute using the autoloader, and 2 rounds per minute with manual loading. The Type 99A mounts an improved 125 mm gun, with a new autoloader capable of firing 10 rounds per minute.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The 125 mm gun of the Type 99 is capable of firing APFSDS-T, HEAT, Frag-HE-T, and gun-launched anti-tank missiles
                        (ATGM). The gun may fire a range of Chinese, Russian, and ex-Warsaw Pact ammunition. The Type 99 can fire tandem shaped charged GP125 ATGMs similar to the Russian Invar with a range of up to 5 kilometres. The 9M119 ATGMs were approved for domestic licensed production by Russia.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The DTW-125 Type II APFSDS ammunition is estimated to be able to penetrate 700 mm of RHA (rolled homogeneous armor) at
                        1000 meters and at least 600 mm of RHA at 2000 meters. The HEAT ammunition is estimated to penetrate 500 mm of armor. The missile has a range of 5000 meters during daylight and a range of 4000 meters during night operation. On
                        Type 99A, an improved variant of DTW-125 features lengthened dart penetrator of 720 millimetres long and denser structure material. U.S. TRADOC describes an unspecified APFSDS-T meant for use with the Type 99 tank as being capable of penetrating 960 mm of RHA at 1000 meters and 800 mm of RHA at 2000 meters.</p>

                        <h3>1.2 - Fire Control</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Type 99 has hunter-killer capabilities, operating an ISFCS-212 fire control system with an IR automatic target
                        tracker. It is capable of firing on the move with a dual-axis stabilized main gun, stabilized gunner thermal sight,
                        an advanced ballistic computer and a laser range finder. The gunner has a maximum target acquisition range of 5 kilometres. The gunner's thermal sight has optical magnification at 5x and 11.4x. The commander also has access
                        to an independent thermal sight with auto-tracking targeting capabilities. A wide range of sensor data is displayed
                        through a computer system to achieve quicker command response.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Type 99A MBT is equipped with an improved fire control system (which includes a new 3rd generation thermal imaging
                        sight, ballistic computer and weather measurement sensors) thus improving ballistic trajectory under adverse conditions.
                        The commander also has an independent panoramic sight with laser range-finding function that can rotate 360 degrees. Both the gunner and commander sight is fully stabilized and capable of day/night operations.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Type 99 and Type 99A are fitted with digital map interface, BeiDou global positioning system, UHF/VHF radio, encrypted
                        laser communication system,[unreliable source?] and other form of communication devices along with an inertial navigation system as well as a C4ISR battle management system used in conjunction with the data-link and communication
                        systems to coordinate combat with other forces such as aircraft and infantry.</p>

                        <h3>1.3 - Protection</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The tank's welded turret is of an angular design with spaced modular armor and composite panels. Applique armor
                        consists of modular armor mentioned above and track skirts. The Type 99A may mount 3rd generation (Relikt-type) ERA that
                        provides protection against tandem-charge warheads. It has a nuclear-biological-chemical protection system as well as fire detection and suppression system. The storage baskets on the turret sides and rear are buffer spaces, and
                        are protected by ERA. The tank is also equipped with an active protection system. Type 99A's protection performance, in combination of the traditional armor, composite mix and reactive armor, is equivalent to more than
                        1000mm of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA), according to an interview with the tank's commander.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The tank features multiple countermeasure systems for additional protection, including laser-based self defense weapon (LSDW) system, laser warning receiver system, twelve 81-mm smoke grenade launchers, and smoke screen generated by injecting fuel into the engines</p>

                        <p class="p2">The box-shaped JD-3 (also known as ZM87) active laser self-defense weapon (LSDW) is installed on the rotating
                        platform behind the tank commander hatch for all Type 99 variants. First seen on the Type 98 prototype, consecutive improvements are introduced over the years. Type 99A features a smaller, more compact LSDW. After the laser warning receiver receives enemy laser illumination, the system would automatically alert the crew, and activate low-intensity
                        laser to search and locate the enemy's laser source, then intensifying the beam to blind the enemy gunner, damage or destroy enemy's optic sensors. The high-powered laser can engage both ground vehicles and helicopters,
                        disrupting guidance signal or damaging gunner's eyesight. The jammer is able to interfere anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) utilizing SACLOS such as the MILAN. The LSDW has a reported effective range of 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) on Type 99, and 4,000 metres on Type 99A. JD-3 (ZM87) system also integrates laser transmitter, serving for both
                        the line-of-sight (LOS) communication and the identification friend or foe (IFF) purpose.</p>

                        <h3>1.4 - Mobility</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The driver sits in the center front of the hull. The latest Type 99A shows the driver's hatch in the center left of the
                        hull. Type 99 features torsion bar suspension system consists of six rubber tired road wheels on each side with power sprocket at the rear. The first, second and sixth road wheels are fitted with special hydraulic shock-buffer. The
                        Type 99A tank is powered by a HP150 1500 hp diesel engine giving it a power-to-weight ratio of about 27.78 hp/ton. The original Type 99 had a manual transmission but later Type 99 variants have a CH1000 hydraulic-mechanical semi-automatic transmission with six forward gears and two reverse gears. The maximum road and off-road speeds are 80 km/h and
                        60 km/h respectively. The cruising range is 500 km. The Type 99A is controlled by a steering wheel/yoke with stick-shift transmission capable of manual and automatic modes. The tank also uses gas and brake pedals similar to that
                        of a standard motor vehicle.</p>
