                            <p class="p1">The Leclerc tank (French: char Leclerc) is a main battle tank built by Nexter Systems of France. It was named in honor of General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, who led the French element of the drive towards Paris while in
                            command of the Free French 2nd Armoured Division (2e DB) in World War II. The designation "AMX-56" – while very popular
                            – is incorrect.</p>

                        <h3>1.1 - Armament</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Leclerc is armed with a 120 mm modèle F1 smoothbore gun designed by the arsenal of Bourges (EFAB) under the
                        designation of CN120-26. Its barrel is 52 calibres long instead of the 44 calibres common on most main battle tanks of its generation, giving the projectile a higher muzzle velocity.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Leclerc is also equipped with a 12.7 mm coaxial M2 heavy machine gun and a roof-mounted 7.62 mm machine gun, whereas
                        most other NATO tanks use 7.62 mm weapons for both their coaxial and top machine gun mounts; the major exception is the American M1 Abrams, which has a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun and two top-mounted machine guns, one 7.62 mm and one 12.7 mm.</p>

                        <h3>1.2 - Autoloader</h3>

                        <p class="p2">Located inside the turret bustle, the autoloader is designated CHA (French, "automatic loading") and was designed by
                        Creusot-Loire Industrie. The autoloader itself weighs 500 kg (empty) and has a total volume of 1.68 m3 (1.40 × 2.40 × 0.50 m). In case of ammunition cooking off, the deflagration is vented by two blow-out panels.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The autoloader allows the reloading of the gun while firing on the move, providing it a sufficient rate of fire to deal
                        with six targets in one minute. The nominal firing sequence is below 8 seconds and the repetition rate (loading two ammunition of the same type one after another) is below 6 seconds. The autoloader is managed by a TM Motorola 680021 microprocessor.</p>

                        <h3>1.3 - Fire Control and Observation</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The last 96 MBT XL Leclerc tanks have the ICONE TIS battle management system with digital communication system which
                        integrates data from other tanks and upper levels of command. Since 2009, all the Leclerc tanks in service (S2 and SXXI)
                        have ICONE BMS. The digital fire control system can be operated independently by the gunner or the commander, and it offers real time integrated imaging from all of the tank's sensors and sights, including the gunner's SAVAN 20 stabilised sight, developed by SAGEM.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Leclerc tank features the HL 60 gunner's primary sight from SAGEM. The sight has two day channels; a direct one with
                        ×3.3 and ×10 magnification (×14 in case of the UAE version) and a video channel with ×10 magnification. The thermal
                        channel offers ×3 and ×10 magnifications. The Athos thermal imager has a detection range of 5000 m, can recognize targets at 2500 m and identify them at 2000 m.The laser range finder is of the Nd:YAG type. No emergency or
                        auxiliary sights are mounted.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The tank commander can observe the surroundings through 7 episcopes and the SFIM HL 70 stabilized panoramic sight. The
                        HL 70 is equipped with a day channel at ×2.5 and ×10 magnification and a night channel with ×2.5 magnification. The UAE
                        tropicalized Leclerc uses the improved HL 80 panoramic sight which features an electronic zoom ×2 and a laser range finder of the Nd:YAG type. The image intensifier is replaced by an Alis thermal imager. The Leclerc SXXI uses the HL 120 panoramic sight that incorporates an Iris thermal imager. Both sights are also equipped with a semi-auto tracker for
                        target acquisition. The combination of the gunner's primary sight and commander's panoramic sight allows the Leclerc to
                        operate in a hunter-killer mode.</p>

                        <h3>1.4 - Protection</h3>

                        <p class="p2">Original protection requirements were sent by the EPC project manager to AMX-APX on February 8, 1980. The protection of
                        the future French main battle tank must guarantee a certain degree of invulnerability against 125 mm APFSDS and 130 mm
                        shaped-charges warheads over its frontal arc.The whole fighting compartment must be protected against RPG-7 warheads and all-around protection should be provided against threats such as 30 mm autocannons.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The turret and the hull are made of welded steel plates with a thickness ranging from 30 mm to 50 mm on which removable composite armor modules are mounted. Twelve modules surround the turret (six per side); they are numbered 1 to 6, starting from the front end. The modules are covered by an anti-slip coating made of fiberglass. The turret bustle that contains the autoloader is protected on both sides against 30 mm armor-piercing rounds and shoulder-fired anti-tank weapon such as the RPG-7. The composite storage boxes around and on the turret play a triple role: carrying the tool set, reducing radar cross-section and acting as spaced armor.</p>

                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <h3>1.4 - Propulsion</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Leclerc has an eight-cylinder SACM (now Wärtsilä) V8X-1500 1,500 hp Hyperbar diesel engine and a SESM (now Renk AG)
                         automatic transmission, with five forward and two reverse gears. The official maximum speed by road is 71 km/h and
                        55 km/h cross country (speeds in excess of 80 km/h were reported on road). The maximum range is given as 550 km, and can
                        be extended to 650 km with removable external tanks. The "hyperbar" system integrates a small Turbomeca TM 307B gas turbine in the engine, acting both as a turbocharger and an APU giving auxiliary power to all systems when the main
                        engine is shut down. The Hyperbar name comes from the unusually high boost pressure of 7.5 bar and the resulting mean
                        effective pressure of 32.1 bar. In comparison, the largest diesel engine in the world (the Wärtsila RTA96) has a
                        mean effective pressure of 18.6 bar.[18] In addition, with boost available even when idling, this arrangement also works
                        as an antilag system..</p>
