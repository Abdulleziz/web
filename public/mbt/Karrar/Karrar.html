                            <p class="p1">The Karrar (Persian كرار lit. Striker or "Attacker") is an Iranian main battle tank. The tank was announced
                            in 2016. At the announcement, it was stated that it possessed an electro-optical fire control system, a laser
                            rangefinder, ballistic computer and could fire at both stationary and mobile targets in day or night.</p>

                        <h3>1.1 - Armament</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The main armament of the Karrar consists of a 125mm 2A46 smoothbore gun fitted with a fume extractor and a thermal
                        sleeve. A remotely operated weapon station armed with a 12.7 mm machine gun is mounted on the roof of the turret. The
                        main gun is able to fire anti-tank laser-guided missiles.[35] A carousel autoloader is also present, removing the need of a loader. </p>

                        </div>

                        <h3>1.2 - Protection</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Karrar is supposedly fitted with latest generation of Iranian composite armor and with explosive reactive armor
                        panels mounted on the hull and turret. There are also armour plates on the sides and slat armour at the rear of the hull
                        and turret. The Karrar has three main types of ERA present. The first is what appears to be an Iranian copy of Relikt on the sideskirts and turret front, an unknown ERA on the top of the turret, and an extremely thick ERA on the front of the hull & turret sides previously seen on Iranian M60 tanks.</p>

                        <h3>1.2 - Countermeasures</h3>
                        
                        <p class="p2">The Karrar features four dazzlers, each containing an electro-optical jammer and 3 laser warning receivers as part of
                        its soft-kill active protection system. Alternative configurations remove the dazzlers, and have a single 360° PLDS-S-1
                        laser warning receiver on top. The same 360° laser warning receiver is present on Iranian M-60 tanks. Once a laser lock
                        is detected, the tank can use it's 12 81mm launchers to deploy a smoke or aerosol screen.</p>

                        <h3>1.3 - Mobility</h3>
                        
                        <p class="p2">Karrar is equipped with a 1000 hp engine. This hasn't been officially stated but signs mounted on Karrar tanks present
                        in Bani Hashem factory, Iran's main AFV factory alongside Shahid Zainuddin, had the words "hp 1000" written on them.
                        Karrar's power to weight ratio is about 20 hp per tonne as a result, and it's speed is stated to be around 70 km/h.</p>

                        </div>

                        <h3>1.4 - Similarity to Russian Tanks</h3>

                        <p class="p2">According to military experts, the Karrar is based on, albeit inferior to, the Soviet-made T-72 and T-90, as well as
                        American M1 Abrams and British Challenger 2.</p>

                        <p class="p2">"It is no coincidence that specialists regard the Karrar as some kind of a copy of the Russian-made T-90MS, the most
                        advanced modification of the T-90 platform", according to retired Maj. Gen. Vladimir Bogatyrev, chair of the Board of
                        the Russian National Association of Retired Military Officers. He also added that "It is based on the T-72 platform, but
                        it also has something from the American Abrams and M60 tanks. Some elements are borrowed from the M48 and the British
                        Chieftain tank. They took all these elements and tried to design their own tank."</p>

                        <p class="p2">Pictures of the composite array of the Karrar tank show it uses reflecting plates, identical to those in Russian T-90
                        and T-72B/S tanks. The turret also looks extremely similar to that of the Russian T-90M/MS tank, albeit with a thicker
                        front.</p>
