                            <p class="p1">The Type 10 (10式戦車, Hitomaru-shiki sensha) is a fourth generation main battle tank of JSDF produced by Mitsubishi Heavy
                            Industries for the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force, entering service in 2012. Compared with other currently-serving
                            main battle tanks in the JGSDF, the Type 10 has been equipped with enhancements in its capability to respond to
                            anti-tank warfare and other contingencies</p>

                        <h3>1.1 - Armor</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The use of modular components significantly improved the side armor compared to the Type 90. The Commander's Panoramic
                        Sight was moved to the right and is located at a higher position than the Type 90, giving the commander a wide range of
                        view.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The vehicle's armor consists of modular sections, providing the ability to mount varying degrees of protection depending
                        on the mission profile and weight requirements. Vehicle weight is 40 tonnes in base configuration, 44 tonnes in standard
                        configuration, and 48 tonnes in full configuration (fully equipped). The prototype featured in 2008 at TRDI weighed 44
                        tonnes.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Compared to the Type 90, the Type 10 is lighter. However, the weight of the composite armor has been greatly increased,
                        from 1,380 kg to 1,940 kg for the turret and from 1,249 kg to 2,680 kg for the hull. In the penetration resistance test,
                        APFSDS type IV (Prototype of Type 10 APFSDS) was used to shoot at full load from 250 m based on the Japanese Ministry of Defense standard "Resilience test method for armored kinetic energy bullets NDS Z 0012B". As a result, it is said that each composite armor module and mantlet achieved the required performance based on the required specification "Type
                        10 tank GV-Y120001E" for frontal protection.</p>

                        <h3>1.2 - Armament</h3>

                        <p class="p2">Whereas the Type 90 used the same 120 mm Rheinmetall main gun as the Leopard 2 tanks, the Type 10 uses a completely new
                        120mm smoothbore gun, developed indigenously by Japan Steel Works. The Type 10's new cannon can fire an improved round, the newly developed Type 10 APFSDS round, which is specifically designed for and can only be fired by the Type
                        10.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Type 10 APFSDS round is composed of amorphous metals containing heavy metal particles. Lightweight ammunition is
                        fired at a high initial velocity (estimated 1,780m/s) due to high pressure. The Japan Steel Works L/44 120 mm has 640 MPa pressure and shoots a 7.8 kg projectile, while the longer Rheinmetall Rh-120 L/55 120 mm has 570 MPa
                        pressure and shoots the heavier DM53 8.35 kg projectile at a similar: 1,750 m/s. The new ammunition is designed to
                        penetrate reactive armor such as Kontakt-5.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Type 10 tank can also fire the JM33 APFSDS (license produced DM33 shell acquired from Germany) as well as all
                        standard 120 mm NATO ammunition. The Type 10 can load 14 rounds in the autoloader, 2 rounds behind the gunner, and 6 rounds in the ready ammunition storage; with a total of 36 rounds carried on board.</p>

                        <h3>1.3 - Electronics</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Type 10 tank is equipped with a C4I system (command, control, communication, computer & intelligence) called "10NW".
                        This system can be incorporated into the JGSDF network to enable sharing of information among tanks in real-time conjunction with "Field Communication System" (FiCS), as well as connected to the infantry's outdoor computer network "Regiment Command Control System" (ReCS) to facilitate integrated military operations with the infantry troops. Currently, the Type 10 tank is the only MBT equipped with the FCP (Fire Control Picture)-level C4I.</p>

                        <p class="p2">According to the specifications described in "Type 10 tank GV-Y120001E", it has the following functions:</p>

                        <p class="p2">The search range for each vehicle can be specified from the platoon leader's vehicle. The detected target is collated with the database and automatically identified, and the distance, position, type, etc.
                        are automatically shared within the platoon.
                        It is possible to instruct each vehicle from the platoon leader's vehicle. It is possible to instruct both concentrated shooting and shooting at individual targets.
                        The platoon leader's vehicle automatically knows where and when the vehicle under command is aiming. When aiming, FCS collates with the database and automatically aims at weak points.
                        When landing, FCS will judge the effect from the landing position and enemy vehicle type, and if uncertain, it will
                        recommend a re-attack.
                        Automatically track multiple detected targets, determine the threat level, and recommend to occupants.</p>

                        <h3>1.4 - Strategic Transportation</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The predecessor of the Type 10, the Type 90 main battle tank, was deployed only in Hokkaido due to the weight limit of
                        roads and bridges in other parts of Japan. One of the primary purposes of Type 10 is to be able to deploy anywhere in
                        Japan. Size and weight reductions have made the Type 10 six tonnes lighter than the Type 90, weighing only 44 tonnes.
                        84% of Japan's 17,920 bridges are passable for the Type 10, compared to only 65% for the Type 90 and 40% for mainstream
                        western main battle tanks.</p>

                        <h3>Development</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The development costs as of 2008 are approximately JPY ¥48,400M (approximately USD $450M). Each unit is expected to cost
                        approximately ¥700M ($6.5M). The Japanese Ministry of Defense formally acknowledged the Type 10 in December 2009. In 2010, the Japanese Ministry of Defense placed a ¥12,400M order for thirteen Type 10 tanks (unit cost: ¥954M).
                        These Type 10 tanks entered JGSDF service in January, 2012. Production continues at a modest but steady rate. Spring
                        of 2020, there were 76 Type 10 tanks in service, with plans to order 12 more that year.</p>

                        <h3>Export Attempt</h3>

                        <p class="p2">On 4 January 2014, sources revealed that Turkey was interested in signing a joint development deal of tank engines based
                        on the Type 10's engine. The Type 10 tank boasts of high mobility, including a backward movement speed of 70 km/h. The engine was to power the Turkish Altay tank. However, negotiations broke down and the deal was "off the agenda" by March 2014. Reasons included Japan's stringent arms export ban laws, the intention of Turkey to attempt to
                        export the Altay, and Japan's reluctance to license the joint engine.</p>
