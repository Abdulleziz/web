                        <h3>Previous Developments</h3>
    
                        <p class="p2">Through the 1960s the US Army and Bundeswehr had collaborated on a single design that would replace both the M60 tank
                        and the Leopard 1. The overall goal was to have a single new design with improved firepower to handle new Soviet tanks
                        like the T-62, while providing improved protection against the T-62's new 115 mm smoothbore gun and especially
                        high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The resulting design, the MBT-70, incorporated new technologies across the board. A hydropneumatic suspension provided
                        improved cross-country ride quality and also allowed the entire tank to be raised or lowered by the driver. New 1,500 hp
                        engines powered the designs which could both reach 69 km/h. The American version used a
                        152 mm gun whose primary long-range weapon was the Shillelagh missile.</p>
    
                        <p class="p2">While the design was highly capable, its weight continued to grow, as did its budget. By 1969, the unit cost stood at
                        five times the original estimates, causing the Department of Defense to suspend the program. Development of the tank
                        continued on an austere basis until January 1970, when the DoD and Germany ended their partnership.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The U.S. Army began work on an austere version of the MBT-70, named XM803. The Army's changes were insufficient to allay
                        concerns about the tank's cost. Congress canceled the XM803 in December 1971 but permitted the Army to reallocate
                        remaining funds to develop a new main battle tank.</p>

                        <h3>Starting Fresh</h3>
    
                        <p class="p2">The XM1 program was approved to begin in January 1973. TACOM began examining specific goals. After several rounds of
                        input, the decision was made to provide armor to defeat the "heavy threat" posed by the T-62's 115 mm gun using
                        projected improvements of their armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) ammunition through the 1980s,
                        and the new 125 mm gun of the T-64 and T-72 firing HEAT rounds. To this end, a new design basis emerged in February
                        1973. It had to defeat any hit from a Soviet gun within 800 m and 30 degrees to either side. The tank would
                        be armed with the 105 mm M68 gun, a licensed version of the Royal Ordnance L7, and a 20 mm version of the M242
                        Bushmaster. The Army later deleted the latter from the design, seeing it as superfluous.</p>
    
                        <p class="p2">In May 1973, Chrysler Defense and General Motors submitted proposals. Both were armed with the 105 mm M68 gun, the
                        licensed L7, and the 20 mm Bushmaster. Chrysler chose a 1,500 hp gas turbine Lycoming AGT1500. GM's model was powered by
                        a 1,500 hp diesel similar to that used on the American MBT-70 and XM803.</p>
    
                        <p class="p2">Prototypes were delivered in 1976 by Chrysler and GM armed with the M68E1 105 mm gun. They entered head-to-head testing
                        at Aberdeen Proving Ground, along with a Leopard 2 AV prototype for comparison. The Leopard 2 was found to meet U.S.
                        requirements but was thought to cost more. The testing showed that the GM design was generally superior to
                        Chrysler's, offering better armor protection, and better fire control and turret stabilization systems. These early
                        preproduction prototypes were provisionally armed with the M68E1 105mm main gun while a preferred 120 mm gun and its
                        ammunition were in their design and component development phase. These prototypes used a combination mount that allowed
                        for evaluating both 105 and 120 mm guns.</p>

                        <h3>Chrysler is Chosen</h3>
    
                        <p class="p2">On 20 July 1976, United States Secretary of the Army Martin Hoffmann and a group of generals visited Deputy Defense
                        Secretary Bill Clements and Director of Defense Research and Engineering Malcolm Currie on their decision. They were
                        surprised when Clements and Currie criticized their decision and demanded the turbine be selected. Donald Rumsfeld heard
                        arguments from both in the afternoon. The Army team spent the night writing briefs and presented them to Rumsfeld the
                        next morning, who then announced a four-month delay.</p>

                        <p class="p2">On 12 November 1976, the Defense Department awarded a $20 billion development contract to Chrysler. The turbine engine does not appear to be the only reason for this decision. Chrysler was the only company that appeared
                        to be seriously interested in tank development; the M60 had been lucrative for the company and relied on that program
                        for much of its profit. In contrast, GM made only about 1% of its income from military sales, compared to 5% for
                        Chrysler, and only submitted their bid after a "special plea" from the Pentagon.</p>

                        <p class="p2">In January 1978, a program was initiated to develop an enhanced version of the 105mm gun, the M68A1 as a
                        possible alternate weapon for the M1 Abrams. The new XM24/L55 gun barrel was 18 inches (45.72 cm) longer in comparison
                        to the XM24/L52 barrel used on the M60 tanks. It has a higher chamber pressure, reinforced breech and a
                        higher muzzle velocity.</p>

                        <h3>Development</h3>
    
                        <p class="p2">Even as the Leopard 1 was just entering service, the West German military was interested in producing an improved tank
                        in the next decade. This resulted in the start of the MBT-70 development in cooperation with the United States beginning
                        in 1963. However already in 1967 it became questionable whether the MBT-70 would enter service at any time in the
                        foreseeable future. Therefore, the German government issued the order to research future upgrade options for the Leopard
                        1 to the German company Porsche in 1967.</p>
    
                        <div class="design-box">

                        </div>

                        <p class="p2">This study was named vergoldeter Leopard (Gilded Leopard) and focused on incorporating advanced technology into the
                        Leopard design. The projected upgrades added an autoloader, a coaxial autocannon and an independent commander's
                        periscope. The anti-air machine gun could be operated from inside the vehicle and a TV surveillance camera was
                        mounted on an extendable mast. The shape of the turret and hull was optimised using cast steel armour, while the
                        suspension, transmission, and engine exhaust vents were improved.</p>
    
                        <h3>Prototype Development</h3>
    
                        <p class="p2">Following the end of the Gilded Leopard study in 1967, the West German government decided to focus on the
                        Experimentalentwicklung (experimental development) in a feasibility study and to develop new components for upgrading
                        the Leopard 1 and for use on a future main battle tank programme. At first 25 million DM were invested, but after
                        the industry came to the conclusion that with such a low budget the development of the two projected testbeds was not
                        possible, a total of 30 to 32 million DM was invested. The experimental development was contracted to the company
                        Krauss-Maffei, but with the obligation to cooperate with Porsche for the development of the chassis and with Wegmann for
                        the development of the turret.</p>
    
                        <p class="p2">Two prototypes with different components were built with the aim of improving the conception of Leopard 1 in such a way
                        that it would match the firepower requirements of the MBT-70. The MBT-70 was a revolutionary design, but after large cost overruns and technological problems, Germany withdrew from the project in 1969. After unsuccessful attempts at saving the MBT-70 by conceptual changes in order to eliminate the biggest issue—the driver being seated in the turret—it became clear in late 1969 that Germany would stop the bi-national development.</p>
    
                        <p class="p2">One year later, a choice was made to continue the development based on the earlier Keiler project of the late 1960s,
                        instead of finishing the development of the Eber. In 1971, the name of the design was determined as Leopard 2 with the
                        original Leopard retroactively becoming the Leopard 1, and Paul-Werner Krapke became the project officer of the Leopard
                        2 program. In 1971, 17 prototypes were ordered but only 16 hulls were built as the production of hull PT12 was cancelled. Ten were
                        ordered initially before another seven were ordered. The 17 turrets were designated T1 to T17, and the hulls were
                        designated PT1 to PT11 and PT13 to PT17. To test a larger number of components and concepts, each prototype was fitted
                        with components not found on the other prototypes. Ten of the turrets were equipped with 105 mm smoothbore guns and the
                        other seven prototypes were equipped with a 120 mm smoothbore gun.</p>

                        <h3>American Evaluation of Leopard 2AV and XM1 Abrams</h3>
    
                        <p class="p2">In July 1973 German Federal Minister of Defence Georg Leber and his US counterpart James R. Schlesinger agreed upon a
                        higher degree of standardisation in main battle tanks being favourable to NATO. By integrating components already fully
                        developed by German companies for the Leopard 2, the costs of the XM1 Abrams, U.S. prototype tank developed after the
                        MBT-70, could be reduced. A German commission was sent to the US to evaluate the harmonisation of components between the
                        XM1 and Leopard 2. However, under American law it was not possible for a public bidder to interfere in a procurement
                        tender after a contract with intention of profits and deadline was awarded to private sector companies.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Leopard 2AV (austere version) was based on the experiences of the previous Leopard 2 development. It was created in
                        order to meet the US requirements and the latest protection requirements of the German MoD. The T14 mod turret was used
                        as the base for the Leopard 2AV's turret, but meeting the required level of protection for the hull required several
                        attempts until the final ballistic trials on 23 to 26 June 1976. Following the US' preference of laser rangefinders,
                        the turret of prototype PT19 was fitted with a laser rangefinder developed together with the American company Hughes.</p>

                        <p class="p2">In Germany, the test conditions were criticised for being unrealistic and favouring the XM1. Instead of using actual
                        performance data, the calculated hypothetical acceleration was used. The XM1 was found to have a slightly higher
                        rate of fire despite having internal layouts similar to the Leopard 2AV because the XM1 prototypes were manned by
                        professional crews, while the Leopard 2AV had to be manned by conscripts in order to prove that the Leopard 2AV was not
                        too complicated. Firing on the move was demonstrated on flat tracks, which nullified the better stabilization
                        systems of the Leopard 2AV.</p>
    
                        <h3>Series Production</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The decision to put the Leopard 2 tank in production for the German army was made after a study was undertaken[when?],
                        which showed that adopting the Leopard 2 model would result in a greater combat potential of the German army than
                        producing more Leopard 1A4 tanks or developing an improved version of the Leopard 1A4 with 105/120 mm smoothbore gun,
                        improved armour protection, a new fire control system and a 890 kilowatts (1,190 hp) or 1,100 kilowatts (1,500 hp)
                        engine. Various changes were applied to the Leopard 2 design before the series production started in 1979.
                        The engine, transmission, and suspension were slightly modified and improved. The ballistic protection of the turret and
                        hull was improved and weak spots were eliminated.</p>

                        <h3>Challenger 1 Contest</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Challenger 2 is the third vehicle of this name, the first being the A30 Challenger, a World War II design using the
                        Cromwell tank chassis with a 17-pounder gun. The second was the Persian Gulf War era Challenger 1, which was the British
                        army's main battle tank from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p class="p2">The Challenger 1 was the winner of a contest that had started with the MBT-80 project to address some of the
                        shortcomings of the Chieftain. While Chieftain was heavily armed and armoured, its engine and suspension were
                        considerably sub-par compared to its contemporaries, leading to poor cross-country performance and a lack of
                        maneuverability. Some work on further development of the Chieftain had been ongoing since 1968 at the Military Vehicles and Engineering
                        Establishment (MVEE), and several experimental vehicles produced, including one with the recently developed Chobham
                        armour. In September 1978, it was announced that these concepts would be brought together in a new design, MBT-80.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Advances in Soviet armor, especially the apparent upcoming introduction of the T-80, suggested that the UK's tanks would
                        be at a significant disadvantage before the MBT-80 would arrive. Vickers suggested that a further developed Shir 2 would
                        meet many of the MBT-80s goals, but could be available as early as 1983. After considerable debate, MBT-80 was
                        cancelled, and the new tank, Challenger, entered service as claimed in 1983.</p>

                        <h3>Challenger 2 Contest</h3>

                        <p class="p2">As Challenger production ramped up the government was interesting in marketing it to its traditional customers like
                        Jordan. To improve its sales prospects, the tank was entered in the 1987 running of the Canadian Army Trophy for tank
                        performance, which had historically been won many times by British Army or Canadian Army units in British tanks. In this
                        run, however, the Challenger performed very poorly, with its units ending up at the bottom of the rankings. While this
                        performance was dismissed by the Ministry of Defense, including in comments in the House of Commons, it was a serious
                        blow to its sales prospects. It also proved only marginally more reliable than the Chieftain, which was considered
                        unreliable and a maintaninance problem in the field, and the lack of significant improvement was much to the annoyance
                        of the British Army.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Vickers began considering improvements under the Improved Challenger name in November 1986. They presented their work to
                        the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in March 1987. In February 1988, the MoD issued Staff Requirement 4026, or the Chieftain
                        Replacement Programme, which called for a new design to replace those Chieftains still in service. This program compared
                        the American Abrams (as the XM1 was now known), French Leclerc and German Leopard 2, as well as Vickers' Improved
                        Challenger. Initial studies by the British Army invariably selected the Leopard 2, which was protected as well as
                        Challenger but had much better mobility and used the smoothbore 120 mm gun that would give it commonality with other
                        NATO forces. The second choice was the Abrams, in second due largely to concerns with its fuel use.</p>

                        <p class="p2">After some supportive lobbying by Baron Young, the Thatcher government chose to proceed with the Vickers entry in
                        December 1988, giving it the official name Challenger 2.</p>

                        <p class="p2">In 1964, studies were initiated about a possible replacement vehicle for the AMX-30 main battle tank: the Engin
                        Principal Prospectif. In 1971, in view of the inferiority of the AMX-30 in comparison to the new generation of Soviet
                        tanks about to be introduced, the Direction des Armements Terrestres ordered the beginning of the Char Futur project. In
                        1975, a working committee was created, and in 1977 it agreed on a list of specifications. In February 1980 however, a
                        Memorandum of Understanding was signed with West Germany involving the joint development of a MBT, called the Napoléon I
                        in France and Kampfpanzer III in Germany. Fundamental disagreements about its desired configuration led to a failure of
                        this cooperation in December 1982. It was announced that a purely French battle tank would be developed, called "EPC"
                        (Engin Principal de Combat). The importation of foreign equipment, like the M1 Abrams, the Leopard 2, or the Merkava,
                        had been studied and rejected.</p>

                        <p class="p2">In 1986, the project was started under the name "Leclerc", and six prototypes were swiftly built. Mass production
                        started in 1990 with the four-unit Batch 1, used mainly for comparative tests in foreign countries. The 17 units of
                        Batch 2 shipped with turret and hull armour improvements, but were diagnosed with engine and suspension problems and
                        quickly retired. Batch 3 followed with further improvements and used to define the doctrine of use as well as
                        instruction. Batches 4 and 5 were better built, eliminating recurring powerplant problems, and are still in service
                        after having been refitted in the late 1990s.</p>
