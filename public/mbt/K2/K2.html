                        <h3>1.1 - Weapon System and Munitions</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The main gun and its munitions were developed simultaneously. In the early to mid 1990s, South Korea learned internal
                        ballistics, external ballistics, and terminal ballistics for tank guns while license producing the KM256 tank gun; they
                        invented self-sharpening tungsten penetrator for 120 mm APFSDS munitions during the K1A1 program. Using acquired
                        technology, engineers decided to increase firepower with longer gun barrels and enhanced propellants that were NATO
                        compatible.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The 125 mm gun of the Type 99 is capable of firing APFSDS-T, HEAT, Frag-HE-T, and
                            gun-launched anti-tank missiles
                            (ATGM). The gun may fire a range of Chinese, Russian, and ex-Warsaw Pact ammunition. The
                            Type 99 can fire tandem shaped charged GP125 ATGMs similar to the Russian Invar with a range
                            of up to 5 kilometres. The 9M119 ATGMs were approved for domestic licensed production by
                            Russia.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Black Panther is armed with a chrome plated CN08 120 mm 55 caliber smoothbore gun developed by the ADD and WIA (now
                        Hyundai WIA), and is capable of hitting a 30 cm size object at range greater than 1 km (0.62 mi). This is complemented by a home-grown bustle-type autoloader, similar to the Leclerc, which allows the tank to fire up to
                        10 rounds per minute. The laser barcode identifier of the autoloader recognizes the classification of pre-barcoded ammunition and selects a type of munition for loading based on mission need. The ammunition is loaded in a
                        16-shell magazine for ready-to-use, and 24 rounds at frontal hull, carrying a total of 40 rounds for its main armament.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Korean Smart Top-Attack Munition (KSTAM) is a fire-and-forget, top-attack anti-tank munition with an effective
                        operating range of 2–8 km, developed specifically for use with the K2. It is launched as a kinetic energy
                        projectile, fired from the main gun in a high trajectory profile comparable to that of a mortar. Upon reaching its
                        designated target area, a parachute deploys, giving on-board millimeter band radar, infrared and radiometer sensors time
                        to seek and acquire stationary or moving targets.</p>

                        <h3>1.2 - Fire Control System and Optics</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The K2 is equipped with an advanced fire-control system linked to an Extremely High Frequency (EHF) L-band Pulsed
                        Doppler Radar system deployed on the frontal arc of the turret, along with a VAS-1K raman laser rangefinder and
                        crosswind sensor. The system is capable of a "lock-on" mode, which can acquire and track specific targets up to a range of 9.8 km using a thermographic camera. This allows the crew to fire accurately while moving as
                        well as engage low-flying aircraft.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Korean Commander's Panoramic Sight (KCPS) and the Korean Gunner's Primary Sight (KGPS) are present in the Black
                        Panther as in the original series of K1A1 tanks, albeit redesigned to utilize the more advanced sensors and armaments deployed on the K2. The K2's Korean Gunner's Primary Sight adopts a thermographic camera that is more advanced than K1A1, and the sight provides 4x and 15x magnifications using the optical system, and 30x and 60x magnifications
                        using a digital image processor.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The tank gun and turret are powered by an EGTDS developed by Hyundai Rotem and Doosan Mottrol (now Mottrol). The EGTDS
                        provides high efficiency and high precision drive control, and its performance is improved by 3-axis stabilization. It is also designed to minimize vibration and noise when the turret is driven. The turret achieved a rotating speed of 800 mil (45 degrees) per second at the prototype stage.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p class="p2">K2 has an Automatic Target Detection and Tracking System controlled by the Automatic Target Recognition
                        algorithm. When the target is identified as a foe by the IFF/SIF (Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification Feature) system, the tank automatically aims and performs laser distance measurements on the target even
                        if the tank is maneuvering on irregular terrain while the target is moving. It can lead the target and fire automatically based on ballistic data calculated by the turret mounted laser rangefinder and crosswind
                        sensor. This feature enhances the performance of inexperienced gunners significantly</p>

                        <h3>1.3 - Network-Centric Warfare Capabilities and Operability</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The K2 houses the following features which help to improve situational awareness for the crew:</p>

                        <p class="p2">C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) uplink.
                        GPS/INS (Global Positioning Satellite/Inertial Navigation System) combined navigation system.
                        IFF/SIF (Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification Feature) system compliant with STANAG 4579.
                        Located on the main gun mantlet, just above the gun, the system fires a 36 GHz beam in the direction of the gun for a
                        response from the targeted vehicle. If a proper response signal is shown by the target, the fire control system
                        automatically identifies it as a friendly. If the target fails to respond to the identification signal, it is
                        then declared as a hostile.
                        C4I linked BMS (Battlefield Management System) allows the vehicle to share its data with friendly units, including other
                        armored vehicles and helicopters.</p>

                        <h3>1.4 - Defensive Capabilities</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The K2 uses modular armor system in order to replace inner material much quicker when its damaged or whenever enhanced
                        version is available. Its armor was redesigned based on K1A1's KSAP, and is made of POSCO MIL-12560H armor steel, Samyang Comtech silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic plates, and aluminum (Al). The frontal armor has been claimed to be effective against the 120 mm APFSDS round fired from the L55 gun. ERA blocks are also
                        present, with the addition of ultra-high hardness and high-hardness armor package and non-explosive reactive armor (NERA) planned for the K2 Product Improvement Program (PIP) and export variant model.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Inside the tank, a positive pressure and air conditioning system are installed to protect the tank crew from chemical
                        weapon and biological weapon, an automatic fire suppression system is programmed to detect and put out any internal fires that may occur, and atmospheric sensors alert the crew if the tank enters a hazardous environment. In addition, the interior of the tank is installed with a neutron shielding liner made of
                        polyethylene-boron moderator to protect the tank crew from neutron radiation from nuclear explosions.</p>

                        <div class="design-box">
                            <figure>

                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p class="p2">The tank is equipped with Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) and Laser Warning Receiver (LWR), which detect homing radar or
                        homing laser aimed at the tank and instantaneously turn the turret in the direction of threats as well as notifying
                        friendly units via network system. The tank also has a total of 12 (6 on each side of the turret) Samyang Chemical K415 Visible/IR Screening Smoke Grenade. The K415 blocks visible and infrared view of the K2 from the enemy.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The K2 has a Multispectral Screening Smoke Grenade (MSSG) soft-kill active protection system. If a anti-tank
                        guided missile (ATGM) is fired at the K2, the tank immediately warns crews and triangulate the projectile for activating
                        SNT Dynamics SLS (Soft-kill Launcher System) that releases K419 multispectral screening smoke grenade, manufactured by Samyang Chemical, in the direction of the incoming missile at the most effective time. The multispectral screening smoke grenades hide tank from visible, forward-looking infrared, and millimeter wave optics and radar thus disrupt accuracy of missile.</p>

                        <h3>1.5 - Mobility and Maneuverability</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The K2 can travel at speeds of up to 70 km/h (43 mph) on road surfaces, accelerate from 0 to 32 km/h (0 to 20 mph)
                        within 7.47 seconds (MT883 Ka-501 engine) or 8.77 seconds (DV27K engine), and maintain speeds of up to 50 km/h in off-road conditions. It can also climb 60% slopes (31 degrees) and vertical obstacles 1.3 meters in height. Due to the relatively compact design of the engine, the designers were able to fit an additional compact Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) into the remaining compartment space. This is capable of producing 8~10 kW, and intended
                        to act as an auxiliary power unit with which the tank may power its on-board systems when its main engine is turned off.
                        It will also allow the tank to conserve fuel when idling and minimize the vehicle's thermal and acoustic signatures.</p>
