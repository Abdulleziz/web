                            <p class="p1">The Merkava (Hebrew: מרכבה, "chariot") is a series of main battle tanks used by the Israel Defense
                            Forces (IDF) and the backbone of the IDF's Armored Corps. Current iterations of this tank are considered broadly
                            equivalent to the capabilities of the M1 Abrams, Leopard 2 and the Challenger 2. The current iteration of this
                            vehicle also shares the same MTU EuroPowerPack powerplant as a number of other MBT platforms.</p>

                        <h3>1.1 - Firepower</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Merkava Mark 1 and 2 were armed with a 105 mm IMI M64 gun, a license-built variant of the M68. The Mark 3, Mark 3 Dor Dalet BAZ kassag, and the Mark 4 are armed with an IMI 120 mm smoothbore gun which can fire almost all versions of
                        Western 120 mm smooth bore tank ammunition, as well as the LAHAT anti-tank guided missile.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The 125 mm gun of the Type 99 is capable of firing APFSDS-T, HEAT, Frag-HE-T, and
                            gun-launched anti-tank missiles
                            (ATGM). The gun may fire a range of Chinese, Russian, and ex-Warsaw Pact ammunition. The
                            Type 99 can fire tandem shaped charged GP125 ATGMs similar to the Russian Invar with a range
                            of up to 5 kilometres. The 9M119 ATGMs were approved for domestic licensed production by
                            Russia.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Each model of the Merkava has two roof-mounted 7.62 mm machine guns for use by the commander and loader and another
                        mounted co-axially with the main gun. A 60 mm mortar is also fitted for firing smoke rounds or suppressing dug-in infantry anti-tank teams.All Merkava tanks are fitted with a remote-controlled M2 Browning .50 caliber heavy machine gun, aligned with the main
                        gun and controlled from within the turret.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The tank's 1,119 kW turbocharged diesel engine was designed by MTU and is manufactured under license by L-3 Communication Combat Propulsion Systems (formerly General Dynamics). The Mark 4's top road speed is 64 km/h.</p>

                        <h2>Merkava Variations</h2>

                        <h3 id="MK1">Merkava Mk I</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Mark 1, operational since 1979, is the original design created as a result of Israel Tal's decision, and was
                        fabricated and designed for mass production. The Mark 1 weighed 63 tonnes and had a 908 horsepower diesel engine, with a power-to-weight ratio of 14 hp/Tonne. It was armed with the 105 millimeter M64 L71A main gun (a licensed copy of the American M68), two 7.62 mm machine guns for anti-infantry defense, and a 60 mm mortar mounted externally, with the mortar operator not completely protected by the tank's hull.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Merkava was first used in combat during the 1982 Lebanon War, where Israel deployed 180 units. Although they were a
                        success, the M113 APCs that accompanied them were found to have several defects and were withdrawn. Merkavas were converted into makeshift APCs or armored ambulances by taking out the palleted ammunition racks in storage. Ten soldiers or walking wounded could enter and exit through the rear door.</p>

                        <h3 id="MK2">Merkava Mk II</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Mark II was first introduced into general service in April 1983. It incorporated numerous small adjustments as a
                        result of the previous year's incursion into Lebanon.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Mark II used the same 105 mm main gun and 7.62 mm machine guns as the Mark I, but the 60 mm mortar was redesigned
                        during construction to be located within the hull and configured for remote firing to remove the need to expose the operator to enemy small-arms fire. An Israeli-designed automatic transmission and increased fuel storage for increased range was installed on all further Mark IIs. Anti-rocket netting was fitted for increased survivability against infantry
                        equipped with anti-tank rockets. Many minor improvements were made to the fire-control system. Updated meteorological
                        sensors, crosswind analyzers, and thermographic optics and image intensifiers gave greater visibility and battlefield
                        awareness.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><b>Newer versions of the original Mark II were designated:</b></p>

                        <p class="p2"><b>Mark IIB</b>, with thermal optics and unspecified updates to the fire control system. <b>Mark IIC</b>, with more armor on the top of the turret to improve protection against attack from the air.
                        <b>Mark IID</b>, with modular composite armor on the chassis and turret, allowing rapid replacement of damaged armor.</p>

                        <p class="p2">In 2015 the IDF had begun a plan to take the old models out of storage and repurpose them as heavy armored personnel
                        carriers. Cannons, turrets, and spaces used to store tank shells inside the hull were removed to create a personnel carrier that outperforms the lighter M113 APC. Converting hundreds of Mark II chassis provides a low-cost way to upgrade support units' abilities to perform medical, logistical, and rescue missions. By late 2016, the last conscripted brigade to operate Merkava 2 was scheduled to transition to Merkava III and Merkava IV tanks for battlefield missions, relegating the vehicles to reserve forces for border patrols during conflicts and conversion to personnel carriers.</p>

                        <h3 id="MK3">Merkava Mk III</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Merkava Mark 3 was introduced in December 1989 and was in production until 2003. As of 2016, the Merkava III was the
                        most numerous tank in frontline IDF service. Compared to the Merkava II, it has upgrades to the drivetrain, powertrain, armament, and electronic systems. The most prominent addition was the incorporation of the locally developed IMI 120 mm gun. This gun and a larger 1,200 horsepower (890 kW) diesel engine raised the total weight of the tank to 65 tonnes, but the larger engine raised the maximum cruising speed to 60 km/h.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The turret was re-engineered for movement independent of the tank chassis, allowing it to track a target regardless of
                        the tank's movement. Many other changes were made, including:</p>

                        <p class="p2">External two-way telephone for secure communications between the tank crew and dismounted infantry, Upgraded ammunition storage containers to minimize ammunition cook-off, addition of laser designators
                        Incorporation of the Kasag modular armor system, designed for rapid replacement and repair in the battlefield and for
                        quick upgrading as new designs and sophisticated materials become available.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Merkava Mark 4 began development in 1999, and production in 2004. The upgrade's development was announced in an
                        October 1999 edition of the military publication Bamachaneh ("At the Camp"). However, the Merkava Mark 3 remained in
                        production until 2003. The first Merkava IVs were in production in limited numbers by the end of 2004.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Removable modular armor, from the Merkava Mark 3D, is used on all sides, including the top and a V-shaped belly armor
                        pack for the underside. This modular system is designed to allow damaged tanks to be rapidly repaired and returned to
                        the field. Because rear armor is thinner, chains with iron balls are attached to detonate projectiles before they hit
                        the main armored hull.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Mark 4 includes the larger 120 mm main gun of the previous versions, but can fire a wider variety of ammunition,
                        including high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT), and sabot rounds like the armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot
                        (APFSDS) kinetic energy penetrator, using an electrical semi-automatic revolving magazine for 10 rounds. It also
                        includes a much larger 12.7 mm machine gun for anti-vehicle operations (most commonly used against technicals).</p>
