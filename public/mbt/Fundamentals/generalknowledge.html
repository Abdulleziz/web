                Modern tanks, or Main Battle Tanks are versatile mobile ground weapons platforms whose main armament is a large-caliber tank gun mounted in a rotating turret gun, supported by other ranged weapons such as machine guns, anti-tank guided missile or rocket launchers. Although tanks are powerful war machines, they rarely operate alone. Despite their armor and mobility, they are vulnerable to over-the-shoulder anti-tank missiles, mines, artillery fire and air strikes. For this reason, they often act together with other troops.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolled_homogeneous_armour" target="_blank">RHA</a>
            <p>Rolled armor steel, also known as RHA (Rolled Homogeneous Armor) is the most common and basic armor steel used for tanks and armored vehicles. It's produced by the Brinnel 380 method. The power of an ammunition is measured by the thickness of armor steel it can penetrate. The RHA type of armor steel is used since World War II and still in active use. RHA; It basically contains low carbon. In addition to ease of production, the low carbon content allows obtaining properties such as good toughness (high energy absorbability), weldability and impact resistance. Their purpose is to eliminate the effects of penetration and explosion damage.</p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_armour" target="_blank">Composite Armor</a>
            <p>Composite armor is a type of armor consisting of layers of different materials such as metals, plastics, ceramics or air. Composite Armor is basically a type of tank armor invented when RHA steels were insufficient in terms of protection against the developing Anti-Tank and ammunition technology. Although they are lighter and take up less space than RHA steels, they provide much superior protection. Each tank's composite armor structure and the materials it uses are different. The composite armor of tanks is placed in what we call "armor right" areas. The first tank to use composite armor was the Soviet-made T-64 tank.</p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_armour" target="_blank">Reactive Armor</a>
            <p>Reactive armors are armor structures produced by placing explosives, plastic or polymer materials between two metal plates or blocks made of composite armor and compressing them in the form of a sandwich. The main purpose of reactive armor is to absorb the energy of the ammunition by affecting the armor-piercing ammunition with explosives hitting the structure used and to reduce the effect it will have on the tank. Although these armors have different advantages and disadvantages depending on their types, they are ineffective against secondary damage from the same area because they are disposable. ERA, SLERA, NERA and NxRA armors are generally used in tanks.</p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-explosive_anti-tank" target="_blank">HEAT,</a>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-explosive_squash_head" target="_blank">HESH,</a>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armour-piercing_fin-stabilized_discarding_sabot" target="_blank">APFSDS</a>
            <p>There are three main tank ammunition of two types. Chemical energy based and Kinetic energy based HEAT, HESH and APFSDS ammunition. HEAT is ammunition containing high explosives that penetrates tank armor with its explosive effect. When the thin tip of the ammunition hits the armor, it explodes and energy is discharged from the thin hollow tip. Thus, attempts are made to penetrate the tank armor. HESH is ammunition containing high explosive plastic. When the ammunition hits the armor, it explodes and damages the armor with shock waves. Pieces inside the armor fly out and break off, killing the crew and damaging equipment. APFSDS is a type of ammunition that penetrates armor with kinetic energy. When the tank fires ammunition, all explosive energy is used to accelerate the penetrating tip. The other pieces break off and only three arrow-shaped piercings remain. This tip can be tungsten, hardened steel or depleted uranium. Tungsten tip is generally used. The tip pierces the armor with kinetic energy and damages the interior of the tank. Thus the tank is destroyed. MKE can produce all these ammunition. Tank guns also fire HE (High Explosive) ammunition. This ammunition is used against infantry, light armored vehicles and buildings, not tanks.</p>
