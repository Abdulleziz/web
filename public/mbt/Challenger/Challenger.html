                            armies of the United Kingdom, Oman, and Ukraine. It was designed by Vickers Defence Systems (now BAE Systems Land & Armaments) as a private venture in 1986, and was an
                            extensive redesign of the company's earlier Challenger 1 tank. The Ministry of Defence ordered a prototype in December 1988.</p>

                        <h2>Design</h2>
                        <h3>1.1 - Armament</h3>

                        <p class="p2">Challenger 2 is equipped with a 120 mm 55 calibre long L30A1 tank gun, the successor to the L11 gun used on Chieftain and Challenger 1. The gun is made from high strength Electro Slag Remelting (ESR) steel with a chromium alloy lining and, like earlier British 120 mm guns, it is insulated by a thermal sleeve. It is fitted with a muzzle reference system and fume extractor, and is controlled by an all-electric control and stabilization system. The turret
                        has a rotation time of 9 seconds through 360 degrees.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Uniquely among NATO main battle tank armament, the L30A1 is rifled, because the British Army continues to place a
                        premium on the use of high explosive squash head (HESH) rounds in addition to APFSDS armour-piercing rounds. HESH rounds
                        have a longer range (up to 8 kilometres or 5 miles further) than APFSDS, and are more effective against buildings and
                        thin-skinned vehicles.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Challenger 2 is also armed with a L94A1 EX-34 7.62 mm chain gun coaxially to the left of the main gun, and a 7.62 mm
                        L37A2 (GPMG) machine gun mounted on a pintle on the loader's hatch ring. 4,200 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition are carried.</p>

                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <p class="p2">The digital fire control computer from Computing Devices Co of Canada contains two 32-bit processors with a MIL STD1553B
                        databus, and has capacity for additional systems, for example a Battlefield Information Control System.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The commander has a panoramic SAGEM VS 580-10 gyrostabilised sight with laser rangefinder. Elevation range is +35° to
                        -35°. The commander's station is equipped with eight periscopes for 360° vision.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The Thermal Observation and Gunnery Sight II (TOGS II), from Thales, provides night vision. The thermal image is
                        displayed on both the gunner's and commander's sights and monitors. The gunner has a stabilised primary sight using a laser rangefinder with a range of 200 m to 10 km. The driver's position is equipped with a Thales Optronics image-intensifying Passive Driving Periscope (PDP) for night driving.</p>

                        <h3>1.2 - Protection</h3>

                        <p class="p2">Challenger 2 is one of the most heavily armoured and best protected tanks in the world. The turret and hull are
                        protected with second generation Chobham armour (also known as Dorchester) the details of which are still classified. Although Chobham armour is classified, the military claims it to be twice as strong as steel. Explosive reactive armour (ERA) kits are also fitted as necessary. The nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection system is located in the turret bustle.</p>

                            </figure>
                        </div>

                        <h3>1.3 - Crew</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The British Army maintained its requirement for a four-man crew (including a loader) after risk analysis of the
                        incorporation of an automatic loader suggested that auto-loaders reduced battlefield survivability. Mechanical failure
                        and the time required for repair were prime concerns.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Like every British tank since the Centurion, and most other British AFVs, Challenger 2 contains a boiling vessel (BV)
                        also known as a kettle or bivvie for water which can be used to brew tea, produce other hot beverages and heat boil-in-the-bag meals contained in ration packs.This BV requirement is general for armoured vehicles of the British
                        Armed Forces, and is one such requirement almost unique to the Armed forces of the UK.</p>

                        <h2>Upgrades and Variants</h2>

                        <h3>Challenger Lethality Improvement Programme</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Challenger Lethality Improvement Programme is a programme to replace the current L30A1 rifled gun with the 120 mm
                        Rheinmetall L55 smoothbore gun currently used in the Leopard 2A6. The use of a smoothbore weapon allows Challenger 2 to
                        use NATO standard ammunition developed in Germany and the US. This includes more lethal tungsten-based kinetic energy
                        penetrators, which do not have the same political and environmental objections as depleted uranium rounds. The
                        production lines for rifled 120 mm ammunition in the UK have been closed for some years, so existing stocks of ammunition for the L30A1 are finite.</p>

                        </div>

                        <h3>Challenger 2E</h3>

                        <p class="p2">Challenger 2E is an export version of the tank. It has a new integrated weapon control and battlefield management
                        system, which includes a gyrostabilised panoramic SAGEM MVS 580 day/thermal sight for the commander and SAGEM SAVAN 15
                        gyrostabilised day/thermal sight for the gunner, both with eyesafe laser rangefinder. This allows hunter/killer operations with a common engagement sequence. An optional servo-controlled overhead weapons platform can be slaved to the commander's sight to allow operation independent from the turret.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The power pack has been replaced with a new 1,500 hp (1,100 kW) EuroPowerPack with transversely mounted MTU MT 883
                        diesel engine coupled to Renk HSWL 295TM automatic transmission. The increase in vehicle performance is significant. The
                        smaller volume but more powerful powerpack incorporates as standard a cooling system and air-intake filtration system
                        proved in desert use. The free space in the hull is available for ammunition stowage or for fuel, increasing the vehicle’s range to 550 km.</p>

                        <p class="p2">BAE announced in 2005 that development and export marketing of 2E would stop. This has been linked by the media to the
                        failure of the 2E to be selected for the Hellenic Army in 2002, a competition won by the Leopard 2.</p>
