                        <h2>Overview</h2>

                        <p class="p2">The Sabra was initially developed as a further evolution of the Magach 7C. The ballistic profile of the appliqué armor
                        was improved and it incorporated the MG253 120 mm gun developed by IMI. The upgrade package was first offered to Turkey as an option for its tank modernization program and later offered for general export. The Turkish government selected the Sabra Mk II (a further modified version of the Sabra) for its upgrade program, which was intended as a
                        stopgap measure. A contract estimated to be worth $688 million USD was signed on March 29, 2002. The first Sabra Mk II
                        was delivered for Turkish trials in 2005 and passed qualifications in May, 2006. 170 were upgraded between 2007 and April, 2009. The upgrades were undertaken by the Turkish Army's 2nd Main Maintenance Center Command, with upgrade kits
                        supplied by IMI.</p>

                        <h2>Sabra Variations</h2>

                        <h3 id="Sabra">Sabra Mk I</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The Mk I was essentially an upgraded Magach 7C. It incorporated a new 120 mm gun developed by IMI, improved applique
                        armor, and the Knight fire control system from Elbit Systems. The running gear would also be upgraded from the Magach to
                        improve cross-country mobility. The hybrid electric and hydraulic turret traverse system from the Magach 7C is replaced
                        with an all-electric system.</p>

                        <h3 id="M60T">Sabra Mk II (M60T)</h3>

                        <p class="p2">Unlike the Mk I which used a low-profile commander's cupola, the Mk II retained the larger M60 Patton style M19 cupola
                        with the M85 12.7 mm machine gun found on the M60s in Turkish service. This version would also include a Commander's
                        Independent Thermal Viewer (CITV). The Mk II also uses a more powerful MTU Friedrichshafen engine built under license in
                        Turkey (MTU Turk A.S.), and a Renk transmission with four forward and two reverse gears. The Mk II is also equipped with
                        explosive reactive armor. The tanks were upgraded by the Turkish military's 2nd Main Maintenance Center with Israeli
                        cooperation. All the systems except the armor package were built under license with technology transfer in Turkey. Sabra
                        can carry 500 litres of diesel fuel.</p>
