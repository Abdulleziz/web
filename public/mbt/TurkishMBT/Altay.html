                            <p class="p1">Altay is a Turkish fourth generation main battle tank designed by Otokar based on South Korean K2 Black Panther to be produced by BMC under design assistance and technology transfer by Hyundai Rotem. It is named in
                            honor of Army General Fahrettin Altay who commanded the 5th Cavalry Corps in the final stage of the Turkish War of
                            Independence. With a unit cost of 13.75 million dollars, the tank design cost is on par with and competitive when
                            compared with relative projects.</p>

                        <h2>Design and Prototypes</h2>
                        <h3>Prototypes</h3>

                        <p class="p2">On 29 April 2009, the Subsecretary for Defence Industries of Turkey, Murad Bayar has confirmed at the 9th IDEX
                        International, Defense Industry Fair in Abu Dhabi, that the Turkish tank will be manufactured using only Turkish
                        resources. He added that the research started last week and that he expected to create an authentic tank model specially
                        designed for the needs of the Turkish Armed Forces within 3 years.</p>

                        <p class="p2">As of September 2010, with approval of the tank subsystems and software by Undersecretariat for Defense Industries,
                        Conceptual Design Phase of the Altay project has been completed. Thus, the project advanced to Detailed Design Phase
                        scheduled to last 30.5 months. The scope of the Detailed Design Phase is to design and integrate interfaces for the
                        selected tank subsystems.</p>

                        <p class="p2">On 15 October 2010, Otokar signed a contract with MTU and Renk for the supply of power pack. On 15 December 2010, Defence Industry Executive Committee decided to start the development of national power pack. On 10 May 2011, Aselsan was contracted by the Undersecretariat for Defense Industries to design and develop two Battlefield Target Identification Device (BTID) prototypes.</p>

                        <p class="p2">On 11 May 2011, the mock-up of the Altay was introduced to the public in IDEF2011. On 18 October 2012, the first Altay was put on trials although lacking side skirts and using a mock-up turret to
                        simulate a real turret. On 16 November 2012, two pre-prototype types, named Altay MTR (Mobility Test Rig) and Altay FTR (Firepower Test Rig), successfully passed initial acceptance tests, paving the way for serial production 2 years earlier than
                        expected, with two more prototypes to be built by 2013 or 2014.</p>

                        <p class="p2">On 7 November 2016, MTR, FTR, PV1 and PV2 (Pilot Vehicle) prototypes made by Otokar were delivered to the Turkish Land
                        Forces, and their acceptance tests were expected to finish in the last quarter of 2016 or early 2017. In May 2019, BMC unveiled Altay's Baseline serial production model, named T1, at the IDEF Defense Exhibition. On 23 April 2023, 2 T2 variant Altays were delived to TAF for further evaluation and testing.</p>

                        <h3>Design</h3>

                        <p class="p2">The tank will benefit both from indigenously developed systems and from technologies of the K2 Black Panther, accorded
                        by an agreement signed with South Korea. The main armament of the tank is the 120 mm 55 caliber smoothbore gun, which was redesigned under license based on the CN08 120 mm gun of the K2 Black Panther. The thermal
                        sleeve of the gun barrel is equipped with a gun stabilizer configured with a static muzzle reference system (SMRS).</p>

                        <p class="p2">The armor package was modified based on the K2's Korean Special Armor Plate (KSAP), but was redesigned for higher
                        ballistic protection in the Altay and will include CBRN defense elements, to protect it from chemical, biological,
                        radiological and nuclear weapons. Also there will be add-on reactive armor.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The planned maximum speed of the first batch is set at 65 km/h, provided by an 1,500 hp engine and the MBTs will be able to function under 4 metres of water. The first mass production tank will be powered by 1,500 hp DV27K engines and EST15K transmissions (6 forward, 3 reverse gears) designed by
                        Hyundai Doosan Infracore (now HD Hyundai Infracore) and SNT Dynamics in South Korea. Whereas the latter batches
                        may powered by an BMC Power BATU V12 12 cylinder V type 1,500 hp engine.</p>

                        <p class="p2">While moving at high speeds, to evade ATGM attacks, sudden braking and manoeuvering at severe angles are capabilities
                        that were taken into consideration from early developmental stages. An isolated ammunition compartment (turret bustle)
                        is designed to protect tank crew, alongside fire and explosion suppression systems that are to activate when hit or when
                        the tank is involved in an accident. The tank is to be equipped with sensors for the detection of contaminated air from
                        chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. The tank also has hunter-killer engagement capability.</p>

                        <p class="p2">ASELSAN made electronic systems produced within the scope of Altay Mass Production Project; Fire Control System,
                        Electric Gun and Turret Engagement System, Command Control Communication and Information System, Driver Vision System,
                        Laser Warning System, Remote Controlled Weapon System, Battlefield Recognition and Identification System, Close Range
                        Surveillance System, AKKOR Active Protection System and embedded training It provides tools to provide user/maintenance
                        training for these products with its simulator.</p>
