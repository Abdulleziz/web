                                <p class="p1">M1 Abrams is a third generation American Main Battle Tank designed by Chrysler Defence (Now General Dynamics Land Systems) and named after General Creighton Abrams. Conceived for modern armored ground warfare and now one of the heaviest tanks in service at nearly 68 short tons.</p>

                                <p class="p1">It introduced several modern technologies to US armored forces, including a multifuel turbine engine, sophisticated Chobham composite armor, a computer fire control system, separate ammunition storage in a blowout compartment, and NBC protection for crew safety.</p>

                                <p class="p1">The M1 Abrams was developed from the failed MBT-70 project that intended to replace the obsolete M60 tank. There are three main operational Abrams versions, the M1, M1A1, and M1A2, with each new iteration seeing improvements in armament, protection, and electronics.</p>

                        <h3>1.1 - Previous Developments</h3>
                        </div>

                        <p class ="p2">Through the 1960s the US Army and Bundeswehr had collaborated on a single design that would replace both the M60 tank
                        and the Leopard 1. The overall goal was to have a single new design with improved firepower to handle new Soviet tanks like the T-62, while providing improved protection against the T-62's new 115 mm smoothbore gun and especially
                        high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds.</p>

                        <div class="row2">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="photos/M60A3.png" height="400" width="500" alt="M60A3">

                            </figure></div>
                        
                            <p class ="p2">The resulting design, the MBT-70 (KPz-70 for Germany), incorporated new technologies across the board. A hydropneumatic suspension provided improved cross-country ride quality and also allowed the entire tank to be raised or lowered by the driver. New 1,500 hp (1,100 kW) engines powered the designs which could both reach 43 miles per hour (69 km/h). The American version used a
                            152 mm gun whose primary long-range weapon was the Shillelagh missile.
                            </p>

                            <p class ="p2">While the design was highly capable, its weight continued to grow, as did its budget. By 1969, the unit cost stood at five times the original estimates, causing the Department of Defense to suspend the program. Development of the tank continued on an austere basis until January 1970, when the Department of Defense and Germany ended their partnership.</p>

                            <div class ="row3">

                            <p class="p2">The U.S. Army began work on an austere version of the MBT-70, named XM803. The Army's changes were insufficient to allay concerns about the tank's cost. Congress canceled the XM803 in December 1971 but permitted the Army to reallocate
                            remaining funds to develop a new main battle tank.</p>

                            <h3>1.2 - XM1 Program</h3>

                            <p class ="p2">The XM1 program was approved to begin in January 1973. TACOM began examining specific goals. After several rounds of input, the decision was made to provide armor to defeat the "heavy threat" posed by the T-62's 115 mm gun using
                            projected improvements of their armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) ammunition through the 1980s,
                            and the new 125 mm gun of the T-64 and T-72 firing HEAT rounds. To this end, a new design basis emerged in February
                            1973. It had to defeat any hit from a Soviet gun within 800 m (2,600 ft) and 30 degrees to either side. The tank would
                            be armed with the 105 mm M68 gun, a licensed version of the Royal Ordnance L7, and a 20 mm version of the M242
                            Bushmaster. The Army later deleted the latter from the design, seeing it as superfluous.</p>

                            <p class="p2">In May 1973, Chrysler Defense and General Motors submitted proposals. Both were armed with the 105 mm M68 gun, the
                            licensed L7, and the 20 mm Bushmaster. Chrysler chose a 1,500 hp gas turbine Lycoming AGT1500. GM's model was powered by
                            a 1,500 hp diesel similar to that used on the American MBT-70 and XM803.</p>

                            <p class="p2">At the time, the Pentagon's procurement system was beset with problems being caused by the desire to have the best
                            possible design. This often resulted in programs being canceled due to cost overruns, leaving the forces with outdated
                            systems, as was the case with the MBT-70. There was a strong movement within the Army to get a new design within budget
                            to prevent the MBT-70 experience from repeating itself. For the new design, the Army stated the unit cost was to be no
                            more than $507,000 in 1972 dollars (equivalent to $3,550,000 in 2022)</p>

                            <p class="p2">Prototypes were delivered in 1976 by Chrysler and GM armed with the M68E1 105 mm gun. They entered head-to-head testing
                            at Aberdeen Proving Ground, along with a Leopard 2 AV prototype for comparison. The Leopard 2 was found to meet U.S.
                            requirements but was thought to cost more. The testing showed that the GM design was generally superior to
                            Chrysler's, offering better armor protection, and better fire control and turret stabilization systems. These early preproduction prototypes were provisionally armed with the M68E1 105mm main gun while a preferred 120 mm gun and its ammunition were in their design and component development phase. These prototypes used a combination mount that allowed for evaluating both 105 and 120 mm guns.</p>

                            <h3>1.3 - Chrysler Is Chosen</h3>

                            <p class="p2">On 20 July 1976, United States Secretary of the Army Martin Hoffmann and a group of generals visited Deputy Defense Secretary Bill Clements and Director of Defense Research and Engineering Malcolm Currie on their decision. Within days, GM was asked to present a new design with a turbine engine. According to Assistant Secretary for Research and Development Ed Miller, "It became increasingly clear that the only solution which would be acceptable to Clements and Currie was the turbine... It was a political decision that was reached, and for all intents and purposes that
                            decision gave the award to Chrysler since they were the only contractor with a gas turbine.</p>

                            <p class="p2">On 12 November 1976, the Defense Department awarded a $20 billion development contract to Chrysler.</p>

                            <h3>1.4 - Production Starts</h3>

                            <p class="p2">In January 1978, a program was initiated to develop an enhanced version of the 105mm gun, the M68A1 as a
                            possible alternate weapon for the M1 Abrams. The new XM24/L55 gun barrel was 18 inches (45.72 cm) longer in comparison
                            to the XM24/L52 barrel used on the M60 tanks. It has a higher chamber pressure, reinforced breech and a
                            higher muzzle velocity.</p>

                            <p class="p2">Low rate initial production (LRIP) of the vehicle was approved on 7 May 1979. In February 1982, General Dynamics
                            Land Systems Division (GDLS) purchased Chrysler Defense, after Chrysler built over 1,000 M1s.</p>

                            <p class="p2">A total of 3,273 M1 Abrams tanks were produced during 1979-1985 and first entered U.S. Army service in 1980. About 5,000 M1A1 Abrams tanks were produced from 1986 to 1992 and featured the M256 120 mm (4.7 in) smoothbore cannon
                            developed by Rheinmetall AG of Germany for the Leopard 2, improved armor, consisting of depleted uranium and other
                            classified materials, and a CBRN protection system. Production of M1 and M1A1 tanks totaled some 9,000 tanks at a cost
                            of approximately $4.3 million per unit.</p>

                            <p class="p2">The Abrams remained untested in combat until the Gulf War in 1991, during Operation Desert Storm. A total of 1,848 M1A1s were deployed to Saudi Arabia to participate in the liberation of Kuwait. The M1A1 was superior to Iraq's Soviet-era
                            T-54/T-55 and T-62 tanks, as well as T-72 versions imported from the Soviet Union and Poland. Polish officials stated that no license-produced T-72 (nicknamed Lion of Babylon) tanks were finished before destruction of the Iraqi Taji tank plant in 1991.</p>

                            <p class="p2">The T-72s, like most Soviet export designs, lacked night-vision systems and then-modern rangefinders, though they did have some night-fighting tanks with older active infrared systems or floodlights. Very few M1 tanks were hit by enemy fire and none were destroyed as a direct result of enemy fire, none of which resulted in any fatalities. Three
                            Abrams were left behind the enemy lines after a swift attack on Talil airfield, south of Nasiriyah, on February 27. One
                            of them was hit by enemy fire, the two other embedded in mud. The tanks were destroyed by U.S. forces in order to
                            prevent any trophy-claim by the Iraqi Army. A total of 23 M1A1s were damaged or destroyed during the war. Of the
                            nine Abrams tanks destroyed, seven were destroyed by friendly fire and two intentionally destroyed to prevent capture by the Iraqi Army. No M1s were lost to enemy tank fire. Some others took minor combat damage, with little effect on
                            their operational readiness.</p>

                            <p class="p2">During operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm some M1IP and M1A1s were modified locally in theater (in the war zone) by modification work orders (MWO) with additional rolled homogeneous armor plating welded on the turret front. Lessons from the war improved the tank's weapons sights and fire control unit.</p>

                            <p class="p2">Further combat was seen during 2003 when U.S. forces invaded Iraq and deposed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the Iraq
                            War's Operation Iraqi Freedom. One achievement of the M1A1s was the destruction of seven T-72s in a point-blank skirmish (less than 50 yards (46 m)) near Mahmoudiyah, about 18 miles (29 km) south of Baghdad, with no U.S. losses. This was in the face of inadequately trained Iraqi tank crews, most of whom had not fired live ammunition in the previous year
                            due to the sanctions then in operation and made no hits at point-blank range.</p>

                            <p class="p2">Following lessons learned in Desert Storm, the Abrams and many other U.S. combat vehicles used in the conflict were
                            fitted with Combat Identification Panels to reduce friendly fire incidents.</p>
                            
                            <p class="p2">Several Abrams tanks that were irrecoverable due to loss of mobility or other circumstances were destroyed by friendly forces, usually by other Abrams tanks, to prevent their capture. Some Abrams tanks were disabled by Iraqi
                            infantrymen in ambushes during the invasion. Some troops employed short-range anti-tank rockets and fired at the tracks,
                            rear and top. Other tanks were put out of action by engine fires when flammable fuel stored externally in turret racks
                            was hit by small arms fire and spilled into the engine compartment. By March 2005, approximately 80 Abrams tanks
                            had been forced out of action by enemy attacks; 63 were shipped back to the U.S. for repairs, while 17 were damaged
                            beyond repair with 3 of them at the beginning of 2003.</p>

                            <p class="p2">Vulnerabilities exposed during urban combat in the Iraq War were addressed with the Tank Urban Survival Kit (TUSK) modifications, including armor upgrades and a gun shield, issued to some M1 Abrams tanks. It added protection in the
                            rear and side of the tank and improved fighting ability and survival ability in urban environments. By December 2006
                            more than 530 Abrams tanks had been shipped back to the U.S. for repairs.</p>

The U.S. considered the RPG-29 a high threat to armor and refused to allow the newly formed Iraqi Army to
                            buy it, fearing that it would fall into the insurgents' hands.</p>

In late 2010, at the request of Regional Command Southwest, the U.S. Marine Corps deployed a small
                            detachment of 14 M1A1 Abrams tanks from Delta Company, 1st Tank Battalion, 1st Marine Division (Forward), to

                            objectives" and was "not an offensive threat to Russia."[78] The plan to transfer the tanks to Ukraine was approved as
                            part of a larger support package. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh specified that the tanks would be the M1A2
                            variant; however, because they were not available in excess in U.S. stocks, they would be purchased through Ukraine
                            Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and could take up to two years to manufacture and deliver. She also acknowledged
                            the challenges of training Ukrainian tank crews and maintaining the tanks in Ukraine.In March 2023 the Pentagon
                            announced that, in order to expedite delivery, older M1A1 variants would be pulled from Army stocks and refurbished for
                            delivery by the fall. This change would also ensure deliveries to US allies of new M1A2s would not be disrupted.</p>
                            

                            <p class="p2">On 25 September 2023, President Zelenskyy announced the arrival of the first batch out of 31 M1 Abrams tanks promised by the United States to Ukraine, without specifying its number, although Politico reported the number to be ten. These machines are ex-U.S. Marine Corps. More tanks, of the initial batch of 31, are expected to be sent "during the fall". More Abrams are also expected in coming months.</p>

                            <p class="p2">Under development as of 2023. On 6 September 2023, the U.S. army announced that it had canceled the planned M1A2 SEPv4 variant and would instead redirect resources into a new variant of the Abrams tank, named M1E3. The new variant will include modular open-systems architecture and is designed to be lighter and more survivable on the battlefield.</p>

                            <p class="p2">Abrams X: is a technology demonstrator of the M1 Abrams series by General Dynamics Land Systems. The AbramsX features a lightweight Watervliet Arsenal XM360 smoothbore gun with pepperpot muzzle brake, an autoloader which reduces the crew to three, an unmanned turret, a hybrid diesel-electric Cummins ACE power pack that gives 50% more fuel efficiency, a 30 mm
                            XM914 chain gun in a remote weapon station, Trophy active protection systems with three launchers, an augmented reality
                            suite that would increase the crews' situational awareness thanks to cameras and sensors mounted around the tank's
                            exterior, a silent mode when running on electric power, the ability to be updated more easily than existing tanks and
